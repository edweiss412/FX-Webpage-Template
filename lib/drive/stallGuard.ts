/**
 * An idle/stall guard for an otherwise-untimed byte-stream read.
 *
 * Unlike the metadata `files.get`/`files.list` guards (a per-attempt TOTAL-time
 * budget — those reads are tiny and fast), asset/revision downloads are large
 * (up to 50MB) and legitimately slow, so a total-time budget would false-abort a
 * healthy-but-slow download. This guard is therefore an IDLE timer: it fires only
 * when no progress is made for `idleTimeoutMs`. Callers `reset()` it on every
 * chunk (wire it to the bounded reader's `onChunk`), so a download that keeps
 * making progress is never aborted, while a stalled (no-bytes) stream trips at
 * `idleTimeoutMs`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - pass `signal` into `fetch(...)` / `drive.revisions.get(..., { signal })` so
 *     the request + (for web streams) the in-flight `reader.read()` abort;
 *   - for Node streams, also register an abort listener that `destroy(err)`s the
 *     stream, since aborting the gaxios request does not reliably interrupt an
 *     already-returned Node Readable consumed by `for await`;
 *   - `reset()` on each chunk; `clear()` in a `finally`;
 *   - `timedOut()` is the source of truth (robust vs abort-error-name variance) —
 *     on a caught error, return null (fail-soft) iff `timedOut()`, else rethrow.
 *
 * The timer is `unref`'d so it never holds the event loop open on its own.
