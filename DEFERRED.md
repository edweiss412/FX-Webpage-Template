# DEFERRED.md

Open deferral queue — work intentionally deferred with a concrete un-defer trigger. Distinct from BACKLOG.md (might do, speculative).

**Resolved / stale / N/A entries live in [DEFERRED-archive.md](./DEFERRED-archive.md)** — full provenance kept there, NOT in this working queue. When an item below ships, move its full entry to the archive.

Last reconciled: 2026-07-24 (strip-mobile graduation) — graduation provenance lives in [DEFERRED-archive.md](./DEFERRED-archive.md) (grep by id).

### VOICEOVER-ANNOUNCER-SPOTCHECK — owner action (2026-07-22)

The warning-announcer-copy bundle's manual assistive-technology half (spec §8
F10 mitigation): owner runs VoiceOver over ignore / bulk-ignore / pointer
reveal on the published Sheet-warnings panel (titled "Parse warnings" until
`feat/warning-trim-undefer`) and confirms one polite utterance
per action, silence on background refreshes, and the reveal focus move. The
automated halves (impeccable audit a11y dimension; role/mutation structural
tests) shipped pre-merge. Un-defer trigger: owner performs and records the
pass.
