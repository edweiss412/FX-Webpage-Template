# DEFERRED.md

Open deferral queue — work intentionally deferred with a concrete un-defer trigger. Distinct from BACKLOG.md (might do, speculative).

**Resolved / stale / N/A entries live in [DEFERRED-archive.md](./DEFERRED-archive.md)** — full provenance kept there, NOT in this working queue. When an item below ships, move its full entry to the archive.

### STRIP-MOBILE-WRAP-1 — [P2] the control strip wraps to a second row at 390px (44px → 80px)

From the impeccable close-out of `modal-header-reconciliation`. §4.5 collapses the sync/edited stack to one line, trading height for WIDTH; §4.3 simultaneously adds a Re-sync trigger to the same row. Below `sm` the strip's `flex-wrap` is live and the row breaks: **44px → 80px** at 390px (`sm:flex-nowrap` leaves ≥sm untouched, so desktop is unaffected). Spec and plan both costed the height saving and neither anticipated the width cost.

**Accepted, not fixed.** Wrapping is the correct responsive behavior here and the alternatives are worse for the actual user: Doug is on a venue floor, one-handed, mid-show, and every control in the band is one he reaches for — truncating or horizontally scrolling a live publish toggle, a Re-sync, or the copy-crew-link button to protect 36px of vertical space is the wrong trade. The band is chrome, not content; the modal body still scrolls independently. The wrap is also already partly designed for: the `·` control divider is `hidden sm:block`, so it does not orphan onto row two.

**Un-defer trigger:** user feedback that the mobile modal header feels tall or that controls jump between rows as status text changes length (the wrap point is data-dependent — it moves with the relative-time strings). The fix is then a deliberate mobile reflow — status line dropped to its own row by explicit `basis-full` rather than incidental wrapping — NOT tightening spacing to squeeze one row.

### STRIP-SKELETON-MOBILE-BAND-1 — [P2] skeleton control band cannot match the loaded band at 390px (73px vs 149px)

Direct consequence of `STRIP-MOBILE-WRAP-1`, surfaced by Task 9's band-parity spec. At ≥sm the skeleton and loaded subheader bands match exactly (**E = 0.00px at 1280**), and the header→subheader seam — the invariant that actually causes the visible load-time snap — matches at **D = 0.30px at BOTH viewports** (bound ≤8px; it failed red at 45.70px/9.70px pre-fix). At 390px the loaded strip wraps to three rows (149px) against the skeleton's single-row 73px.

**Accepted, not fixed, and the tolerance was NOT widened** (the plan explicitly forbids that). The plan nominated skeleton bar heights as the lever, but they cannot close this: the wrap point is a function of rendered DATA, since the status line's width depends on its relative-time strings. Sizing placeholders to reproduce one fixture's 3-row wrap was rejected as overfitting — it would go green while asserting nothing about any real show. The 390px case therefore asserts an honest weaker clause (band reserves ≥ one tap row + `py-2`, never exceeds the loaded band) and the ≤4px strictness is kept at ≥sm where its "single control row" premise actually holds.

**Un-defer trigger:** resolving `STRIP-MOBILE-WRAP-1` (a deliberate mobile reflow makes the loaded mobile band deterministic, at which point exact parity becomes assertable again), or user reports of a visible header jump on mobile loads.
