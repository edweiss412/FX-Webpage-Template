# DEFERRED.md

Work intentionally deferred (will do, concrete trigger). Distinct from BACKLOG.md (might do, speculative). Each entry: what, why deferred, and the concrete trigger that un-defers it.

## Per-day schedule/key-times — impeccable gate (2026-06-22)

Source: invariant-8 impeccable v3 dual-gate (critique + audit) on branch `per-day-schedule-keytimes` vs `aef09fbc`. Full findings + dispositions in `.superpowers/sdd/task-19-impeccable-report.md`. Gate verdict: critique 34/40 PASS, audit 18/20 PASS, deterministic detector `[]`, zero CRITICAL. No HIGH/CRITICAL left unaddressed — F1 and F2 are FIX-RECOMMENDED to the implementer; the entries below are the explicit DEFER fallbacks + the P3 polish/real-browser items.

### D1 — [P2] KeyTimesStrip onto `<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>` (semantic-structure drift)

- **What:** `components/crew/primitives/KeyTimesStrip.tsx:123-140` renders presentational `<div><span><span>` for each label/value pair, while the two sibling primitives doing the identical job use `<dl>` (`RightNowHero.tsx:553-573`, `KeyValueRows.tsx:64,91,94`). SR reads the strip as a flat text run with no label↔value association (WCAG 1.3.1 A).
- **Why deferred:** the inv6 test contract reads first/last `<span>` (`tests/components/crew/primitives.test.tsx:262-264` + e2e `crew-layout-dimensions.spec.ts` `span.first()`/`span.last()`); a `<dl>` migration is feasible (keep label/value spans as first/last children inside `<dt>`/`<dd>`) but touches the test contract. Deferred only if that churn is out of scope this milestone; otherwise the implementer should fix now.
- **Trigger:** next touch of KeyTimesStrip, OR the next a11y/semantics pass on crew primitives, OR if any SR-audit flags the strip. Closes the systemic "three primitives, three structures" drift in one move.

### D2 — [P1] Overflow row "+N more" deep-link / recessive restyle (DEFER FALLBACK for F1)

- **What:** `KeyTimesStrip.tsx:95-102` overflow row ("More days" / "+N more") is styled identically to data rows with no affordance and no path to the full per-day list.
- **Why deferred:** FIX-RECOMMENDED now (preferred: make it a `SectionChipLink section="schedule"` like `TodaySection.tsx:568`, or restyle recessive). Deferred only if not fixed this milestone — bounded by cap=5 + realistic max ~3 show days (rarely hit).
- **Trigger:** a show with >5 visible show days appears in real data, OR the next KeyTimesStrip touch. Un-defer immediately if a 6+-show-day show ships.

### D3 — [P3] Normalize time-meridiem casing across anchors

- **What:** Set "9:00PM" (`resolveKeyTimes.ts:109`) vs window/showStart "7:30am" stacked in one strip column; also DayCard "Setup 10:00PM". Reads as un-curated sheet passthrough.
- **Why deferred:** the fix lives in `lib/crew/resolveKeyTimes.ts` (non-UI; not strictly an invariant-8 surface) — a copy-quality polish, not a gate blocker. Window en-dash "–" is correct and stays.
- **Trigger:** a copy/voice polish pass on key-times, OR the next resolveKeyTimes touch. Add one meridiem-normalizer helper applied uniformly to Set/Show/Strike/window/showStart.

### D4 — [P3] Real-browser 390px density check (8-row strip) — REAL-BROWSER PASS

- **What:** worst case Set + 5 shows + overflow + Strike = 8 rows in the narrow "Daily call times" card (`ScheduleSection.tsx:276`, defaults to `stack`).
- **Why deferred:** requires a real browser render; the app could not boot in the gate environment.
- **Trigger:** PR Vercel preview — capture the "Daily call times" card at 390px with a 5-show fixture, confirm no crowding/clip. If dense, lower the visible cap to 3 before overflow.

### D5 — [P3] Per-day date as `<time>`; middot speech

- **What:** `KeyTimesStrip.tsx:133-138` renders "Day 1 · Wed 10/8" as plain text; `data-anchor-date` (ISO) is on a `<div>`, not a `<time>`. `RightNowHero` wraps dates in `<time>`. Some SRs verbalize "·".
- **Why deferred:** low impact (informational strip); separator copy is owned by `resolveKeyTimes.labelFor`, not the component.
- **Trigger:** addressed alongside D1 (the `<dl>` migration), OR an SR audit flags the middot. Wrap the date in `<time dateTime={row.date}>` or swap the separator.

### D6 — [P3] DESIGN.md §1.2 — publish `text-subtle` on `--color-surface` (dark) — REAL-BROWSER MEASURE

- **What:** `text-text-subtle` at 12px is used on the card fill (`--color-surface`) for the meta line (`DayCard.tsx:105`) + strip labels (`KeyTimesStrip.tsx:133`), but DESIGN.md §1.2 only publishes the ratio on `--color-bg`. Dark surface `#16171C` is slightly lighter than bg → marginally below the 6.4:1 bg figure (still ≥ AA-large; at/near AA-body for these eyebrow/meta uses; not used for any action target).
- **Why deferred:** exact measurement requires a real render against the live `globals.css` dark surface.
- **Trigger:** PR Vercel preview — measure subtle-on-dark-surface; add a `--color-surface` row to DESIGN.md §1.2 with the computed ratio.

## /help prose typography layer — impeccable gate (2026-06-22)

Source: invariant-8 impeccable v3 dual-gate (critique + audit) on branch `feat/help-prose-typography` (the P0 typography fix from the help-center readability audit, `docs/help-readability-audit-2026-06-22.md`). Gate verdict: critique PASS (no P0/P1), audit PASS-WITH-MINOR (no P0/P1), deterministic detector `[]`. One audit P3 deferred here; the system-wide audit P2 is filed as `BL-ACCENT-ON-BG-AA-CONTRAST` in BACKLOG.md. Both the audit P2 (body-link contrast) and P3 (callout-link contrast on tinted fills) were resolved IN this PR across two Codex adversarial-review rounds: prose links inherit the high-contrast body/box text color + underline in EVERY state (no sub-AA accent at rest OR on :hover — round 2 caught the hover regression; WCAG 1.4.3 is not waived for hover text), so they clear AA everywhere. Hover feedback is the cursor + the always-present underline.

### D7 — [P3] /help/errors heading order skips h2 (h1 → RefAnchor `as="h3"`)

- **What:** `app/help/errors/page.tsx:33` renders `<h1>Errors</h1>` then each code entry as `RefAnchor as="h3"` (`:40`) — there is no h2, so the heading outline skips a level (WCAG 1.3.1 best-practice). The new `.help-prose` scale (h1 24px → h3 18px) makes the skip visually apparent; before the layer every heading was 16px so it was invisible.
- **Why deferred:** pre-existing (the skip predates this PR — the page always used `as="h3"`); my change only restyled it. The fix (change the per-code entries to `as="h2"`, or add an h2 grouping heading) touches the ratified RefAnchor D.5 catalog-vs-chapter contract (`RefAnchor.tsx:11-29`), so it needs a deliberate decision rather than a drive-by edit inside a typography pass.
- **Trigger:** the next `/help/errors` touch, the planned errors-index restructure (audit §6 Chunk 4 — code-family grouping + jump-list, which will introduce real h2 groupings anyway), OR an SR/heading-order a11y audit. Confirm against the D.5 contract before editing.

## /help catalog tables — impeccable critique P2 (2026-06-22, Chunk 2)

### D8 — [P2] 390px 3-column catalog tables render as very tall wrapped cells

- **What:** the dashboard sync-status and settings health-badge tables keep all 3 columns at 390px (~110px each), so prose wraps hard — the "⚠ Changes to review" row is ~11 lines tall and the "Couldn't reach Drive / …" status cell ~7 lines (impeccable critique P2, Chunk 2). It does NOT overflow horizontally (measured `scrollWidth == innerWidth == 390`; cells wrap) and is fully readable + AA — but a tall thin 3-col block on a phone is only marginally faster to scan than the old bullets, eroding the scannability the table conversion is selling on the mobile-primary surface.
- **Why deferred:** the fix is a `.help-prose` responsive-table enhancement (Chunk-1 territory), not a content edit. The best option is a CSS stacked-card transform at ≤480px (each row → a labeled card: Status as heading, meaning + action as label:value), but generic markdown tables carry no per-column data-labels, so that needs either per-table data attributes the MDX can't emit or a scoped nth-child/::before label map — more than Chunk 2's scope. A simpler `overflow-x:auto` wrapper won't help (cells wrap, so the table never exceeds the column). These are admin reference tables, consulted occasionally and mostly at desk width.
- **Trigger:** operator feedback that the mobile catalog tables are hard to scan, OR a future chunk that adds a wider table, OR a dedicated `.help-prose` responsive-table pass. Implement the ≤480px stacked-card transform (with the column headers carried as `::before` labels) at that point.
