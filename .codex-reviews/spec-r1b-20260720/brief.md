# Adversarial spec review — attention scenario gallery + materialize (Round 1)

## Your role: REVIEWER ONLY

Do not fix issues, do not propose patches as commits, do not imply changes you will make. Challenge the design and surface findings. Fixes are the implementer session's job in a separate dispatch.

Do NOT invoke any nested cross-model review (`/codex:adversarial-review`, codex-companion, `/codex:review`). Your verdict comes from YOUR direct output.

Do NOT run shell commands or tools. The full artifact is inlined below; review it as text. Everything you need is here.

## Posture

Fresh eyes. You have not seen this design before. It is a NEW spec for a dev-only instrument in a Next.js 16 + Supabase admin app (FXAV Crew Pages).

## Context you need

The app has an admin "show modal" whose attention surface renders:

- alert pills / menus / section banners derived from `admin_alerts` rows
- parse-warning cards derived from `shows_internal.parse_warnings` (a jsonb array)
- "hold" items derived from a change feed (`sync_holds`)

Routing from alert code to modal section is a table `ATTENTION_ROUTES` in `lib/admin/attentionItems.ts`. `deriveAttentionItems` turns raw rows into `AttentionItem`s; `bucketAttention` (`lib/admin/sectionAttention.ts`) buckets them to sections with fallback predicates (`sectionAvailable`, `anchorAvailable`, `crewKeyRendered`).

The problem: most alert/warning codes never fire against test data, so their rendered state is never seen.

Project invariants that bind this design (abbreviated):

- Inv 2: every mutation of `shows`/`crew_members`/`crew_member_auth`/`pending_syncs`/`pending_ingestions` runs inside a per-show advisory lock, acquired at EXACTLY ONE layer (nested holders deadlock).
- Inv 5: no raw error codes in user-visible UI; copy resolves through `lib/messages/lookup.ts`.
- Inv 8: any UI surface ships only after `/impeccable critique` AND `audit`.
- Inv 9: every Supabase call destructures `{ data, error }`; infra faults surface as typed discriminable results.
- Inv 10: every mutating server action / route is instrumented. Admin-gated mutations need an `AUDITABLE_MUTATIONS` registry row PLUS executable success-branch behavioral proof. Emits are post-commit, outside any lock.
- Dev routes under `app/admin/dev/` are gated BUILD-TIME by `scripts/with-admin-dev-flag.mjs`, which renames registered files aside before `next build` so the production artifact never contains them.
- Editing a `§12.4` error-code catalog row requires three lockstep updates in one commit (master spec prose, `pnpm gen:spec-codes` regen, `lib/messages/catalog.ts` row) or the `x1-catalog-parity` CI gate blocks merge.
- Tailwind v4 in this project does NOT default `.flex` to `align-items: stretch`; any fixed-dimension parent with flex/grid children needs an explicit Dimensional Invariants section verified in a real browser.

## EXPLICITLY DO NOT RELITIGATE

These were decided with the user during brainstorming and are ratified in §1.1 of the spec. Verify the spec is INTERNALLY CONSISTENT with them; do not argue the decisions themselves:

1. Gallery renders T1 + T2 only; T3 composites are materialize-only. (Mounting the whole surface against a synthetic snapshot fixture was considered and rejected.)
2. No CI gate: no screenshot byte-comparison, no catalog-completeness meta-test.
3. No migration. Clear regenerates warnings via the existing re-sync path instead of stashing a backup.
4. Gallery server actions are inert by design (synthetic alert ids).
5. The gallery is dev-only and absent from the production artifact.
6. The tool is for a solo developer/operator evaluating their own admin UI; it is not a customer-facing feature.

## What I want you to attack

Exhaust each finding class in THIS round. If you identify a defect shape, enumerate EVERY instance of it in the document — a repeated vector dripped one instance per round is a review defect, not thoroughness.

Highest-value vectors:

- **Correctness of the claimed data flow.** Does the described catalog actually produce the states it claims? Are there states in the real surface the design cannot reach, or claims to reach but cannot?
- **Guard/edge coverage.** Null, empty, zero, malformed inputs. Every query param. Every action precondition. Anything the spec leaves undefined at a boundary.
- **Invariant compliance.** Especially inv 2 (lock topology), inv 9, inv 10 (is the registry/behavioral-proof story complete and correct?), and the build-time gate story (§6) — is the stated test shape actually sufficient to prove the artifact claim?
- **Internal contradictions.** Any section contradicting another, any number contradicting §2, any "out of scope" claim contradicted by a requirement elsewhere.
- **Cleanup/leak.** The materialize tag-and-delete story: can it strand rows, delete real rows, or leave the target show in a state the operator cannot recover from? Consider concurrent applies, interrupted applies, and applies against a show with pre-existing real alerts.
- **Ambiguity.** Any requirement an implementer could read two ways.

## Output format

## THE ARTIFACT (current revision - five defects already repaired since first draft)

# Attention scenario gallery + materialize — design

**Date:** 2026-07-20
**Branch:** `feat/attention-scenario-gallery`
**Status:** draft (pending cross-model adversarial review)

---

## 1. Problem

The admin show modal's attention surface — alert pills, section banners, compact alert cards, parse-warning cards — is only observable when live sheet data or an operator action happens to raise the underlying row. Most of the 45 registered alert codes and 43 parse-warning codes never fire against the test shows, so their copy, routing, tone, and layout are unverified by eye. The existing unit and meta tests pin _structure_ (routing totality, no-drop, copy parity) but nothing renders the surface for a human.

Two distinct gaps:

1. **No sweep.** There is no way to see every state at once and judge copy/layout/routing.
2. **No drive.** There is no way to put a chosen state in front of the real modal, at the real URL, with working buttons.

This design closes both from one catalog.

## 1.1 Resolved scope — do not relitigate

These were decided during brainstorming. Cite the ratification before re-opening.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Gallery renders **T1 + T2 only**; T3 composites are materialize-only. Duplicating a full `get_admin_show_review_snapshot` fixture to mount `ShowReviewSurface` was considered and rejected as a drift liability.                                                                                           | §4.3, §5.1                |
| **No CI gate.** No screenshot byte-comparison, no catalog-completeness meta-test. The eyeball tool is the deliverable. Totality is instead achieved structurally (§3.1) so a gate is not needed for the alert axis.                                                                                        | §3.1, §9                  |
| **No migration.** Clear regenerates authentic warnings via the existing re-sync path rather than stashing a backup in a new column or table.                                                                                                                                                               | §5.4                      |
| **No new advisory-lock holder.** Materialize writes only `admin_alerts`, `shows_internal.parse_warnings`, and `sync_holds` — none in the invariant-2 guarded set. The Clear path's re-sync acquires the lock inside existing code (`POST /api/admin/sync/[slug]`), so the single-holder rule is untouched. | §7.2                      |
| Gallery **server actions are dead ends by design** (fake alert ids). Client-side affordances are live. Driving actions for real is materialize's job, not the gallery's.                                                                                                                                   | §4.4                      |
| The gallery route is **dev-only and absent from the production artifact**, gated by the existing build-time rename mechanism, not by a runtime check alone.                                                                                                                                                | §6                        |
| `attention-gallery-full.png` (an earlier ad-hoc screenshot at the repo root) is **discarded**, not folded in.                                                                                                                                                                                              | user decision, 2026-07-20 |

`N_ROUTES_OVERVIEW + N_ROUTES_CREW + N_ROUTES_EVENT + N_ROUTES_ROOMS + N_ROUTES_WARNINGS = N_ALERT_CODES` (34+3+3+3+2 = 45).

Cross-check: `ADMIN_ALERTS_CODES` (`tests/messages/adminAlertsRegistry.ts:9`) also has 45 entries and is pinned set-equal to `ATTENTION_ROUTES` by `tests/admin/_metaAttentionRoutes.test.ts`.

## 3. Catalog — the single source of truth

**Module (new file):** `lib/dev/attentionScenarios.ts (new)`

A scenario declares **storable inputs** — the shapes that actually live in the database — never pre-built `AttentionItem`s and never derived read-model shapes. This is the load-bearing constraint of the whole design (§3.3):

```ts
export type AttentionScenario = {
  id: string; // stable slug, used as the DB tag and the gallery anchor
  tier: 1 | 2 | 3;
  label: string;
  alerts: ScenarioAlertRow[]; // storable admin_alerts columns only, see below
  holds: ScenarioHoldRow[]; // storable sync_holds columns only, see below
  warnings: ParseWarning[]; // lib/parser/types.ts:48 - stored verbatim as jsonb
  bucket?: Partial<BucketOpts>; // T2 only: see §4.2
  degraded?: boolean; // T2 only: see §4.2
};

// Exactly the columns fetchPerShowAlerts selects (lib/adminAlerts/fetchPerShowAlerts.ts:100),
// plus the identity the gallery cannot resolve for synthetic rows (§3.3).
export type ScenarioAlertRow = {
  code: string;
  context: Record<string, unknown>; // NOT NULL in the DDL - use {} not null
  raisedAt: string;
  occurrenceCount: number;
  galleryIdentity?: AlertIdentity | null; // gallery-only; materialize resolves for real
};

// The storable hold shape (lib/sync/holds/types.ts:12-25), not the derived FeedEntry.
export type ScenarioHoldRow = Omit<SyncHold, "id" | "showId">;
```

Both consumers run the **real** `deriveAttentionItems` (`lib/admin/attentionItems.ts:303`) and the **real** `bucketAttention` (`lib/admin/sectionAttention.ts:85`). Nothing hand-builds an `AttentionItem`. Consequence: routing, `tone`, `actionable`, `autoClearNote`, `crewKey` derivation, `safeDougFacingTemplate` fallback, `catalogHelpHref`, `readFailedKeys`, `readDataGapsDigest`, and `readErrorCode` are all exercised for real. The catalog cannot misrepresent routing, because it never states routing.

### 3.1 Alert totality is structural, not listed

T1 alert scenarios are **derived at runtime** from `Object.keys(ATTENTION_ROUTES)`, not hand-listed. A new alert code appears in the gallery the moment its `ATTENTION_ROUTES` row lands — no catalog edit, no drift, and no completeness meta-test needed (which is why §1.1 can decline the gate without accepting drift).

Realistic params come from an override map keyed by code:

```ts
const ALERT_ROW_OVERRIDES: Partial<Record<string, Partial<ScenarioAlertRow>>> = { ... };
```

A code with no override gets a generic default row (`occurrenceCount: 1`, `context: {}`, `galleryIdentity: null`, fixed `raisedAt`). `context` defaults to `{}` and never `null`: `admin_alerts.context` is `jsonb not null` (`supabase/migrations/20260501001000_internal_and_admin.sql`), so a null default would be gallery-legal but un-insertable, and the two consumers would diverge at exactly the point §3.3 forbids.

Codes whose card content depends on context **must** carry an override or the gallery shows their degenerate form:

| Code                                                                     | Required override                                | Why                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TILE_PROJECTION_FETCH_FAILED`                                           | `context.failedKeys: string[]`                   | `readFailedKeys` (`lib/admin/attentionItems.ts:233-236`) returns null for any other code or a non-array |
| `SHOW_FIRST_PUBLISHED`                                                   | `context` shaped for `readDataGapsDigest`        | gated on that exact code (`lib/admin/attentionItems.ts:279`)                                            |
| `PARSE_ERROR_LAST_GOOD`                                                  | `context.error_code` ∈ `PARSE_FAILURE_ALLOWLIST` | `readErrorCode` (`lib/admin/attentionItems.ts:242-246`) drops anything else                             |
| `AMBIGUOUS_EMAIL_BINDING`, `OAUTH_IDENTITY_CLAIMED`, `ROLE_FLAGS_NOTICE` | `crewName`                                       | crew-routed codes bind `crewKey` only when `crewName` is set (`lib/admin/attentionItems.ts:255-256`)    |

Any code whose catalog `dougFacing` template carries `<placeholder>` tokens needs `messageParams` that fully interpolate, or `safeDougFacingTemplate` returns null and the card falls back — which is itself a state worth seeing, so T2 keeps one deliberate non-interpolating scenario (§4.2).

**Guard — `PICKER_EPOCH_RESET`:** it has an `ATTENTION_ROUTES` row for registry totality but is filtered out in derive. The gallery renders it as an explicit **"cut in derive, renders nothing"** row rather than silently omitting it, so the absence is legible instead of looking like a bug.

### 3.2 Warning totality and its known gap

No single runtime module enumerates the parse-warning universe:

- `INTERNAL_CODE_ENUMS` (`lib/messages/__generated__/internal-code-enums.ts`) is generated, runtime-importable from `lib/`, and yields `N_WARN_ENUM` codes with `source: "parse_warnings.code"`. Its generator (`scripts/extract-internal-code-enums.ts:71-72`) only scans files matching `/\bParseWarning\b|\bwarnings\b|hardErrors/`, so emitters in other files are missed.
- `WARNING_CARD_COPY_CODES` (`tests/messages/warningCardCopyRegistry.ts:4`) has 40 codes but lives under `tests/` — `lib/` must not import it — and is itself not a superset.
- `MESSAGE_CATALOG` (`lib/messages/catalog.ts`) contains all of them but carries no severity or source field to partition on (see e.g. the all-null `TYPO_NORMALIZED` row at `lib/messages/catalog.ts:1709-1718`).

Measured difference between the two registries:

| In copy registry, absent from generated enum (`N_WARN_GAP` = 4)          | In generated enum, absent from copy registry (3)                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AGENDA_SCHEDULE_LOW_CONFIDENCE` (`lib/agenda/extractAgendaSchedule.ts`) | `BLOCK_DISAPPEARED` (`lib/parser/warnings.ts`)                      |
| `AGENDA_SCHEDULE_TIME_ADJUSTED` (`lib/sync/enrichAgenda.ts`)             | `DAY_RESTRICTION_DOUBLE_LOCATION` (`lib/parser/personalization.ts`) |
| `PULL_SHEET_ON_ARCHIVED_TAB` (`lib/sync/pullSheetOverride.ts`)           | `TYPO_NORMALIZED` (`lib/parser/blocks/venue.ts`)                    |
| `PULL_SHEET_OVERRIDE_CONTENT_CHANGED` (`lib/sync/pullSheetOverride.ts`)  |                                                                     |

**Decision:** the warning universe is `INTERNAL_CODE_ENUMS` filtered to `parse_warnings.code`, **plus** an explicit `EXTRA_WARNING_CODES` constant holding the `N_WARN_GAP` codes above, each with the `file:line` comment justifying its presence. Total `N_WARN_CODES`. This is mostly self-updating (new codes in scanned files appear free) and honest about the residue.

**Backlog, not in scope:** widen the generator's scan heuristic so `EXTRA_WARNING_CODES` can be deleted. Filed as `BL-INTERNAL-CODE-ENUM-SCAN-WIDEN`.

### 3.3 Fidelity contract between the two consumers

The instrument's entire value rests on one property: **what the gallery shows for a scenario is what materialize produces for that scenario.** A catalog field the gallery honors but materialize cannot reproduce is worse than no tool, because it teaches the operator a state that does not exist.

The database stores less than the modal renders. `fetchPerShowAlerts` selects only `id, code, context, raised_at, occurrence_count` (`lib/adminAlerts/fetchPerShowAlerts.ts:100`) and then **derives** `identityText`, `messageParams`, and `crewName` (`lib/adminAlerts/fetchPerShowAlerts.ts:169-172`) from `context` plus a DB-resolved `AlertIdentity`. Likewise `FeedEntry` (`lib/sync/holds/types.ts:60-77`) is derived by `readShowChangeFeed` from `sync_holds` rows; its `summary` is generated from the hold's disposition, not authored.

Therefore the catalog declares **only storable fields** (§3), and each derived field is produced by the same code in both consumers:

| Field                                            | Stored?                           | Gallery                                         | Materialize                                         | Divergence risk                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`, `context`, `raisedAt`, `occurrenceCount` | yes                               | honored verbatim                                | inserted verbatim                                   | none                                                      |

| `AlertIdentity` itself                           | no — resolved from real crew rows | **declared** via `galleryIdentity`              | **resolved** by `resolveAlertIdentities`            | inherent, see below                                       |
| hold `summary`, `action`, `status`               | no — derived                      | shared feed shaping                             | shared feed shaping                                 | none, same condition                                      |
| `ParseWarning[]`                                 | yes, jsonb                        | honored verbatim                                | written verbatim                                    | none                                                      |

**Required refactor:** extract the DB-independent tail of `fetchPerShowAlerts` — the `(row, identity) -> { identityText, messageParams, crewName }` step at `lib/adminAlerts/fetchPerShowAlerts.ts:169-172` — into an exported pure function, and have both `fetchPerShowAlerts` and the gallery call it. Same for the `FeedEntry` shaping step in `readShowChangeFeed` (`lib/sync/feed/readShowChangeFeed.ts:286-318`) if it is not already callable in isolation. Without this the fidelity contract is an aspiration; with it, drift is a compile-or-test failure rather than a silent divergence.

**The one inherent divergence:** identity _resolution_ needs real crew rows, which synthetic alerts do not have. The gallery therefore takes a declared `galleryIdentity` where materialize resolves the real thing. This is stated, not hidden: the routing readout (§4.1 step 2) labels the identity as `declared (gallery)`, so the operator knows that one field is the instrument's assumption rather than the system's answer.

## 4. Gallery

**Route (new file):** `app/admin/dev/attention-gallery/page.tsx (new)` — Server Component, `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, `requireDeveloper()` at the top, matching the posture of `app/admin/dev/source-link-dim/page.tsx` and `app/admin/dev/telemetry-dim/page.tsx`.

### 4.1 What a scenario block renders

Rendered elements, in order, per scenario — these are actual DOM, not conceptual descriptions:

1. **Heading** — `<h2>` with the scenario `id` as its `id` attribute (deep-linkable anchor) and `label` as text.
2. **Routing readout** — a `<dl>` listing, per derived item: `code`, `kind`, `tone`, `sectionId`, `anchor` (or `—`), `actionable`, `autoClearNote` (or `—`), `template` resolved vs `fallback`. Wrong routing is then legible as text, not merely as a card in the wrong place.
3. **`AttentionMenu`** (`components/admin/showpage/AttentionMenu.tsx:42`) with `items` = derived items, `open` = true so the menu body is visible without a click, `onClose`/`onNavigate` = no-ops, `pillRef` = a local ref.
4. **Bucketed banners** — `bucketAttention(items, opts)` with `renderCard` = `AttentionBanner` (`components/admin/review/AttentionBanner.tsx:91`), one group per bucketed section, each labelled with its `sectionId`.
5. **Hold rows** — rendered separately and labelled as such, because `bucketAttention` deliberately excludes `kind: "hold"` items (`lib/admin/sectionAttention.ts:93-97`); they belong to the Changes feed via `Mi11GateActions`. Omitting them here would misread as a drop.
6. **`PerShowActionableWarnings`** (`components/admin/PerShowActionableWarnings.tsx:47`) with `items` = `scenario.warnings`, `driveFileId` = a fixed fake id, `renderItemControls` omitted, rendered **twice** for tiers where the scenario declares it — once `tone="warning"`, once `tone="muted"` — since the muted skin is the collapsed "Ignored (N)" state and has its own contrast posture.

### 4.2 T2 structural axes

`BucketOpts` (`lib/admin/sectionAttention.ts:30-39`) already exposes the fallback predicates as injectable functions, so T2 drives them directly with no fake show:

| Axis                         | Mechanism                                     | Expected visible outcome                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Routed section not rendered  | `sectionAvailable: () => false`               | banner falls back to Overview                                                                                                           |
| Anchor slot absent           | `anchorAvailable: () => false`                | anchored card falls back to its section top                                                                                             |
| Crew key has no rendered row | `crewKeyRendered: () => false`                | crew banner goes to the crew section top                                                                                                |
| Alert vs hold                | scenario carries only `alerts` / only `holds` | hold appears in the hold group, never a banner                                                                                          |
| Actionable vs auto-clearing  | inbox-routed and auto-resolving codes         | resolve control absent; `autoClearNote` line present                                                                                    |
| Occurrence 1 vs N            | `occurrence_count: 1` / `7`                   | repeat-count affordance                                                                                                                 |
| Identity present/absent      | `identityText` set / null                     | `menuSubtitle` present / absent                                                                                                         |
| Uncataloged code             | code absent from `MESSAGE_CATALOG`            | `ATTENTION_FALLBACK_TITLE` (`lib/admin/attentionItems.ts:84`)                                                                           |
| Unresolved placeholder       | params that leave a `<token>`                 | `template` null, card falls back                                                                                                        |
| Item count 0 / 1 / many      | scenario item lists                           | empty state, single, and a menu long enough to exercise scroll                                                                          |
| Degraded alert read          | `degraded: true`                              | derived items from holds only, plus the degraded pill + Overview notice the loader produces at `app/admin/_showReviewModal.tsx:304-310` |

**Cap:** the "many" scenario is fixed at 12 items. Above that the menu is a scroll container, and 12 is enough to cross the threshold without turning the gallery into a wall. The cap is a named constant in the catalog, referenced by the scenario, not a bare literal.

### 4.3 Tier boundaries

- **T1** — one scenario per alert code (`N_ALERT_CODES`, of which `N_ALERT_RENDERABLE` render) and one per warning code (`N_WARN_CODES`). Copy and routing sweep.
- **T2** — the §4.2 matrix. Structural sweep.
- **T3** — composites. **Rendered by materialize only.** The gallery lists T3 scenarios by `id` and `label` with a note pointing at the dev panel, so they are discoverable but not faked.

### 4.4 Interactivity boundary

Client-side affordances are genuinely live: menu open/close, `?` help popovers (`components/admin/compactAlertHelp.tsx`), expand/collapse, hover, focus rings. Server actions are **not** — alert ids are synthetic, so a resolve submit fails. This is deliberate and stated on the page: a short standing note at the top reading that actions are inert here and that the dev panel materializes a scenario for real interaction.

**Known fidelity caveat:** `AttentionBanner` reads `usePathname()` (`components/admin/review/AttentionBanner.tsx:101`) and feeds it to a route-gated Learn-more link. Under the gallery the pathname is `/admin/dev/attention-gallery`, not the modal route, so that gate evaluates differently than in production. The routing readout (§4.1 step 2) therefore prints the `route` value it passed, making the difference explicit rather than silently misleading.

### 4.5 Controls

Query params only; no client state.

| Param      | Values                            | Effect                                  | Default       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `tier`     | `1`, `2`                          | render only that tier                   | both          |
| `scenario` | scenario `id`                     | render only that scenario               | all           |
| `w`        | integer px, clamped `[320, 1280]` | wrap each block in a fixed-width column | unconstrained |

Guards: an unparseable or out-of-range `w` falls back to unconstrained; an unknown `scenario` renders an explicit "no such scenario" line listing valid ids, never an empty page; `tier` outside `{1,2}` renders both. A `tier=3` request renders the T3 list from §4.3 with its materialize note.

## 5. Materialize

**Where:** a new card on the existing `/admin/dev` panel (`app/admin/dev/page.tsx`), which is already `requireDeveloper`-gated and build-gated. Controls: scenario select (all three tiers), target show slug, target environment, **Apply** and **Clear**.

### 5.1 Apply writes

| Target                                      | Write                                                                                                   | Tag                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `admin_alerts`                              | insert one row per `scenario.alerts`                                                                    | `context.__devScenario = "<scenario id>"`              |
| `sync_holds` (`lib/sync/holds/holdPort.ts`) | insert one pending row per `scenario.holds`                                                             | same key in the row's context/payload                  |
| `shows_internal.parse_warnings`             | overwrite with `scenario.warnings` (`components/admin/review/publishedAdapter.ts:92` reads this column) | not taggable — jsonb array of `ParseWarning`; see §5.4 |

Apply is **idempotent per (show, scenario)**: it first deletes existing rows tagged with that scenario id for that show, then inserts. Re-applying does not accumulate duplicates.

#### 5.1a The one-unresolved-alert-per-code constraint

`admin_alerts` carries a partial unique index (`supabase/migrations/20260501001000_internal_and_admin.sql`):

```sql
create unique index admin_alerts_one_unresolved_idx
  on public.admin_alerts (coalesce(show_id::text, ''), code) where resolved_at is null;
```

**At most one unresolved row per (show, code).** Two consequences the design must honor rather than discover at implementation:

1. **A scenario may not carry two alert rows of the same code.** Enforced in the catalog by construction and asserted by a test (§12); a duplicate would fail the insert at runtime.
2. **A code that already has a real unresolved row on the target show cannot be inserted.** Apply therefore **skips** that code and names it in the result: `skipped: [{ code, reason: "unresolved row already present" }]`. It does **not** resolve, delete, or overwrite the real row — the promise that Apply never touches untagged rows is kept by declining, not by clobbering.

This also settles materialize's scope. The full per-code sweep (T1, `N_ALERT_RENDERABLE` codes) belongs to the gallery, which has no DB and no constraint. Materialize's scenarios are T3 composites carrying a handful of codes, where a skip is rare, visible, and harmless.

### 5.2 Clear

1. Delete every `admin_alerts` row for the show whose `context.__devScenario` is set — **any** scenario, not just the selected one, so a half-applied state cannot strand rows.
2. Delete every correspondingly tagged `sync_holds` row.
3. Trigger `POST /api/admin/sync/[slug]` (the path `ReSyncButton` already uses, `components/admin/ReSyncButton.tsx:243`) to re-parse from source and full-replace `parse_warnings` with authentic content.

Clear reports which of the three steps succeeded.

### 5.3 Guard conditions

| Condition                                                    | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Show archived                                                | refuse — archived shows have their own modal posture and are not the surface under evaluation                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Scenario id unknown                                          | refuse, no writes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Zero tagged rows at Clear                                    | succeed, report "nothing to clear", still run the re-sync                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Re-sync unreachable (no Drive creds locally)                 | Clear reports `warnings_not_regenerated`; tagged alert/hold deletion still committed. Synthetic warnings persist until the next successful sync; the operator escape hatch is a reseed. This is the one non-self-healing edge and it is stated in the card's copy. |
| Apply against a show that already has real (untagged) alerts | allowed. Codes that do not collide are inserted; codes whose unresolved row already exists are **skipped and named** in the result (§5.1a). Real rows are never resolved, deleted, or overwritten.                                                                 |
| Scenario carries duplicate alert codes                       | rejected before any write, with the duplicate named (§5.1a)                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Apply interrupted partway                                    | the next Apply or Clear is safe: both are keyed on the `__devScenario` tag, so a partial write is fully addressable. Clear deletes **every** tagged row for the show regardless of which scenario wrote it (§5.2 step 1).                                          |
| Two Applies race on the same show                            | last writer wins per code; no lock is taken (invariant 2 does not cover these tables, §7.2). Acceptable because materialize is a single-operator dev instrument, never a concurrent surface. Stated rather than defended.                                          |

### 5.4 Why `parse_warnings` is overwritten rather than backed up

A backup would need durable storage: a new column or a new dev table, i.e. a migration plus the `validation-schema-parity` post-migration checklist. Re-sync already regenerates the column authentically from source, so the backup buys nothing that the existing path does not. The cost is the §5.3 unreachable-Drive edge, accepted explicitly.

### 5.5 Environment targeting

Default target is **local**. Validation requires an explicit confirm in the UI **and** a complete `VALIDATION_SUPABASE_URL` + `VALIDATION_SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` + `VALIDATION_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` triple, resolved exclusively from that triple with no fallback to ambient `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` — the same guardrail shape the observe CLI uses (AGENTS.md, Telemetry access). A non-loopback ambient `SUPABASE_URL` is refused without the explicit validation confirm. Any missing or invalid member of the triple is a hard error.

Production is never a target: the route does not exist in the production artifact (§6).

## 6. Build-vs-runtime gate

The gate is **build-time**, not runtime. `scripts/with-admin-dev-flag.mjs` renames the files in its `FILES` array (`scripts/with-admin-dev-flag.mjs:43-55`) to `.disabled-by-build-gate` before `next build` whenever `ADMIN_DEV_PANEL_ENABLED` is not the literal `"true"` at invocation time, so the artifact does not contain the route at all. `requireDeveloper()` remains as runtime defense in depth for dev builds where the panel is enabled.

**Files added to `FILES`:** `app/admin/dev/attention-gallery/page.tsx (new)`. The materialize card lives inside the already-registered `app/admin/dev/page.tsx` and `app/admin/dev/actions.ts`, so it inherits their registration.

**Gate test shape (build-time, not runtime):** extend the existing build-artifact assertion (`tests/admin/build-artifact-gate.test.ts`) so a build produced with the flag **unset** contains no reference to the gallery route, and the `FILES`-membership assertion in `tests/admin/withAdminDevFlagDevPanelPresent.test.ts` covers the new path. A runtime probe alone would not prove the artifact claim.

## 7. Invariant compliance

### 7.1 Invariant 10 — mutation surface observability

Two new admin-gated server actions in `app/admin/dev/actions.ts`, mirroring the existing `parseAndStage` / `resetDevSchema` precedent (`tests/log/_auditableMutations.ts:227-230`):

| Action                       | Code                   | Registry                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `applyAttentionScenario`     | `DEV_SCENARIO_APPLIED` | `AUDITABLE_MUTATIONS` row + success-branch behavioral proof |
| `clearAttentionScenario`     | `DEV_SCENARIO_CLEARED` | same                                                        |
| their `*FormAction` wrappers | same codes             | rows, as the existing wrappers have                         |

Emits are post-commit via `logAdminOutcome` (`app/admin/dev/actions.ts:74`), outside any lock. No secret is logged: the emitted context carries the scenario id, show slug, and row counts only.

**These codes do NOT take the §12.4 lockstep.** `logAdminOutcome`'s `code` is a free SHOUTY_SNAKE_CASE string (`lib/log/logAdminOutcome.ts:9`), not a `MessageCode`. The existing `DEV_PARSE_STAGED` and `DEV_SCHEMA_RESET` appear only in `app/admin/dev/actions.ts`, `tests/log/_auditableMutations.ts`, and `tests/log/adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts` — they have **no** master-spec §12.4 row and **no** `lib/messages/catalog.ts` entry. Adding one would put a non-message code into the message catalog and risk the `x1-catalog-parity` gate rather than satisfying it. The registration surface for these two codes is the two test registries and nothing else; no `pnpm gen:spec-codes` run is required by this change.

### 7.2 Invariant 2 — advisory locks

Materialize writes `admin_alerts`, `sync_holds`, and `shows_internal.parse_warnings`. None is in the invariant-2 guarded set (`shows`, `crew_members`, `crew_member_auth`, `pending_syncs`, `pending_ingestions`). The Clear path's re-sync acquires the per-show lock **inside existing code** behind `POST /api/admin/sync/[slug]`. **Holder topology unchanged; no new holder at any layer.**

### 7.3 Invariant 5 — no raw error codes in UI

The gallery's routing readout prints raw codes deliberately — it is a developer instrument behind `requireDeveloper`, and the codes are the subject under inspection, not an error surfaced to an operator. The rendered **cards** still resolve copy through the real catalog path, so the contract holds where it applies. The materialize card's own errors resolve through `lib/messages/lookup.ts`.

### 7.4 Invariant 8 — UI quality gate

The gallery route and the dev-panel card are UI surfaces. `/impeccable critique` and `/impeccable audit` both run on the diff before close-out; P0/P1 fixed or deferred via `DEFERRED.md`.

### 7.5 Invariant 9 — Supabase call boundary

Every Supabase call in the materialize action destructures `{ data, error }`, distinguishes returned from thrown errors, and surfaces infra faults as a typed discriminable result. New call sites either add a row to the relevant registry meta-test or carry an inline `// not-subject-to-meta: <reason>`.

## 8. Dimensional invariants

**N/A — declared explicitly.** The gallery is a vertical flow of blocks with no fixed-height or fixed-width parent containing flex/grid children whose stretch behavior is load-bearing. The `w` param sets a `max-width` on a wrapper, which constrains width only and imposes no parent→child height relationship. The components rendered inside carry their own production styling and their own dimensional coverage where they have it. No real-browser layout task is required by this change.

## 9. Transition inventory

**Scope boundary:** this change adds no new animated component. The transitions inside `AttentionMenu`, `AttentionBanner`, and `CompactAlertCard` are pre-existing and already covered (`tests/components/admin/compactAlertCompoundTransitions.test.tsx`, `tests/components/admin/transitionAudit.test.tsx`).

The gallery's own states are two, and both are server-rendered navigations, not animated state changes:

| From      | To                                   | Treatment                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| full list | filtered (`tier` / `scenario` / `w`) | instant — a server navigation, no animation needed |
| filtered  | full list                            | instant — same                                     |

No `AnimatePresence`, no ternary-rendered animated branch, is introduced.

No column is empty; no zombie flag introduced.

## 12. Meta-test inventory

**Extends:**

- `tests/log/_auditableMutations.ts` — two `AUDITABLE_MUTATIONS` rows plus their `*FormAction` rows (§7.1).
- `tests/log/adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts` — success-branch behavioral proof for both actions.
- `tests/admin/withAdminDevFlagDevPanelPresent.test.ts` and `tests/admin/build-artifact-gate.test.ts` — the new route path (§6).

**Creates:** none.

**Explicitly declined:** a catalog-completeness meta-test. The alert axis needs none (totality is structural, §3.1); the warning axis has a stated, enumerated residue (§3.2) whose closure is a backlog item, not a gate.

**New behavioral tests (not meta):**

- `deriveAttentionItems` over every catalog scenario returns items whose `sectionId` matches `ATTENTION_ROUTES` — reusing the catalog as fixture data. Failure mode caught: a scenario whose override params make a code derive to an unexpected section.
- Apply → Clear round trip leaves **zero** rows tagged `__devScenario` for the show, asserted by counting tagged rows directly against the DB, not by trusting the action's own report. Failure mode caught: a Clear that deletes only the selected scenario's rows and strands the rest.
- Apply twice with the same (show, scenario) yields the same row count as applying once. Failure mode caught: non-idempotent insert accumulating duplicates.
- Guard cases from §5.3 (unknown slug, archived show, unknown scenario id) commit no writes — asserted by row counts before and after, not by the returned error alone.
- **No scenario carries two alert rows of the same code** (§5.1a). Asserted across the whole catalog, not a sampled scenario. Failure mode caught: a catalog addition that renders fine in the gallery and fails the unique index the first time anyone materializes it.
- **Apply skips a colliding code and names it.** Seed a real unresolved alert of code C on the target show, apply a scenario containing C plus a non-colliding code D. Assert: D inserted, C reported in `skipped`, and the pre-existing C row is **byte-identical afterward** — same `id`, `raised_at`, `occurrence_count`, `resolved_at`. Failure mode caught: an Apply that "handles" the collision by resolving or overwriting the operator's real alert.
- **Fidelity contract (§3.3).** For a scenario applied to the DB, the derived fields the gallery computes (`identityText`, `messageParams`, `crewName`) equal the fields `fetchPerShowAlerts` returns for the same row, given the same identity. Asserted against the two call paths' outputs, not against a hand-written expectation, so the test fails if the shared derivation is forked. Failure mode caught: the gallery and the real modal rendering different copy for the same scenario — the one failure that makes the whole instrument misleading rather than merely incomplete.

## 13. Out of scope

- Screenshot regression gate, byte-compared baselines, and the Docker/arch pinning they require (§1.1).
- Rendering T3 composites in the gallery (§1.1, §4.3).
- Widening the internal-code-enum generator's scan heuristic (§3.2, backlog).
- Any change to the production show modal, its components, or their behavior. This design **adds** dev surfaces and touches no production render path.
- Making gallery server actions functional (§4.4).
