# Deferred Items Log

Non-blocking findings from milestone adversarial reviews that were intentionally deferred rather than fixed in-milestone. Each item names a suggested home milestone where it should be picked up. **This is not a TODO list to clear automatically** — every entry has context for why it was deferred and where the right place to address it is.

When picking up a deferred item:
1. Move it from "Open" to "In progress" with the milestone it landed in.
2. Resolve it in that milestone's handoff doc convergence log.
3. Update the row to "Resolved" with the commit SHA + milestone reference.

## Open

### M2-D1 — Hardcoded admin allow-list rotation

**Source:** M2 adversarial review, Round 1 advisory note
**Description:** `ADMIN_EMAILS` is env-driven (set once in `.env.local` per spec §14.3), but there is no documented rotation procedure, audit trail, or in-product UX for adding/removing admins. Today the only path is "edit env, redeploy."
**Why deferred:** Out of M2 schema scope. Doesn't block anything functional — admins work, the allow-list is honored. It's an ops-hardening question.
**Suggested home:** M9 (polish) or X.* (cross-cutting). Could also land as a separate ops doc rather than code.

### M2-D2 — Static-vs-runtime breadth for the 21 admin-table RLS matrix

**Source:** M2 adversarial review, Round 1 advisory note
**Description:** AC-2.5 tests pin the §4.3 admin-only table list (21 tables × 4 verbs = 84 cells) at schema-introspection time. There is no runtime probe that the *live* policy set still matches §4.3 after future migrations land. A future migration could silently drop or weaken a policy and current tests wouldn't catch it.
**Why deferred:** M2's introspection coverage is correct for "what shipped at M2." Runtime drift detection is a separate concern, and the right time to add it is when there are actually multiple migrations in play (M3+).
**Suggested home:** X.6 (traceability matrix walker) — it already enumerates spec sections, can be extended to assert live-policy parity. Alternatively land it as part of the next M2-touching migration.

### M2-D3 — `transportation.show_id` single-row uniqueness model

**Source:** M2 adversarial review, Round 1 advisory note
**Description:** Schema treats `(show_id)` as the unique key on `transportation`, allowing only one transport row per show. Spec §4 / parser output supports a single transport block per show, but production-shaped sheets sometimes carry multiple drivers/vehicles per show.
**Why deferred:** Matches current spec + parser. Changing it requires a spec amendment, not a fix-in-place. Until a real fixture demands multi-driver, the constraint is intentional.
**Suggested home:** Treat as a spec question. If/when a fixture surfaces with multi-driver, open a brainstorming session for a spec amendment, then schema-bump in a new migration (NOT an edit of the M2 file).

### M2-D4 — Missing introspection pin for `crew_members_show_id_name_key`

**Source:** M2 adversarial review, Round 1 advisory note
**Description:** The `crew_members_show_id_name_key` named unique constraint exists in the migration but is not asserted by name in `tests/db/schema-introspection.test.ts`. Other named constraints in the same table are pinned.
**Why deferred:** Cosmetic — the constraint is in place and functions correctly; it's just missing from the introspection allow-list. Unlikely to drift in isolation.
**Suggested home:** Fold into the next M2-touching change (e.g., when M5/M6 add code that depends on the constraint). One-line test addition.

### M2-D5 — Seed's hardcoded restage fixture filename

**Source:** M2 adversarial review, Round 1 advisory note
**Description:** `supabase/seed.ts` hardcodes a specific raw-fixture filename for the restage scenario rather than deriving it from `fixtures/shows/raw/`. If that fixture is renamed or replaced, seed silently breaks.
**Why deferred:** Works against today's fixture set. The general fix (glob + filter) is mild refactoring that's easier to do alongside the next seed change rather than in isolation.
**Suggested home:** Whenever seed is next touched (likely during M4 tile development when a new fixture variant is needed for testing).

### M2-D6 — App-side advisory-lock helper shape deferred to consumer milestones

**Source:** M2 adversarial review, Round 1 advisory note
**Description:** Plan-wide invariant §1.2 mandates per-show advisory locks on every code path that mutates `shows` / `crew_members` / `crew_member_auth` / `pending_syncs` / `pending_ingestions`, with tests asserting the lock is held. M2 ships the schema that supports this; the actual helper and the lock-held tests live with the code paths that hold the lock (M5 auth, M6 sync).
**Why deferred:** Defensible separation of concerns — testing "the lock is held" requires a code path that holds it, which doesn't exist until M5/M6.
**Suggested home:** M5 handoff §6 (watchpoints) — explicitly call out that M5's auth-side mutations need the helper authored. M6 handoff §6 — same for sync. The helper itself probably belongs in `lib/db/advisoryLock.ts`.

### M4-D1 — ShowStatusTile event_details key probing should route through parser canonical-key authority

**Source:** M4 catch-up code-quality review, 2026-05-03 Important Minor 2
**Description:** `components/tiles/ShowStatusTile.tsx` probes for the dress-code value across stringly-typed key candidates `["dress_code", "dress code", "dress", "attire"]`. Tile should consume the canonical key only; parser should expose a `CANONICAL_KEY_MAP` (or similar) that decides the variant collapse upstream.
**Why deferred:** Crosses into M1-parser territory. Out of M4 catch-up scope; the tile-side variant-tolerant probe is acceptable until the parser exposes canonical keys.
**Suggested home:** M1 follow-up touch OR a cross-cutting key-canonicalization task. When picked up, simplify the tile to read `event_details.dress_code` only, parser-side guarantees the canonical form.

### M4-D2 — Tile reorder by persona urgency

**Source:** M4 catch-up `/impeccable critique`, 2026-05-03 (Finding 1 HIGH)
**Description:** Tile mount order in `app/show/[slug]/page.tsx` is parser-output order (Lodging→Venue→Crew→Contacts→Schedule→Audio→Video→Lighting→Transport→ShowStatus→Financials→PackList→Notes). Crew on the venue floor scans top-to-bottom; the answer to "what's my call time" (ScheduleTile + relevant scope tile) sits buried 5+ tiles in. PackListTile (set/strike-day primary answer) renders 12th.
**Why deferred:** Reorder is a UX/IA judgment call that benefits from a proper `/impeccable shape` session — the canonical v3 flow we skipped on this milestone. Doing it under M4 close-out pressure would risk a parser-order-to-persona-order refactor without the design context.
**Suggested home:** M9 polish with explicit `/impeccable shape <crew page reorder>` session before crafting. Group tiles by Today / Logistics / People / Reference, OR introduce a "Today" cluster that promotes 1-2 today-relevant tiles above the general grid.

### M4-D3 — Header weight competes with RightNowCard for the page hero

**Source:** M4 catch-up `/impeccable critique`, 2026-05-03 (Finding 5 MEDIUM)
**Description:** `components/layout/Header.tsx` show title is `text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold` — same scale as the RightNowCard lead. The eyebrow `client_label` is the same `text-xs uppercase` as every tile heading. Result: header competes visually with both the hero card and the tile grid; nothing dominates.
**Why deferred:** Visual-rebalance call that benefits from a `/impeccable shape` session.
**Suggested home:** M9 polish. Either shrink the header (smaller title, condense to a sticky-thin bar) so the RightNowCard wins the page's primary moment unambiguously, OR commit to header-as-context (smaller title, drop the orange hairline which fights the RightNowCard's accent dot for the eye).

### M4-D4 — RightNowCard data-* test attribute relocation

**Source:** M4 catch-up `/impeccable critique`, 2026-05-03 (Finding 6 MEDIUM)
**Description:** `components/right-now/RightNowCard.tsx` carries 3 `data-*` test attributes (`data-state`, `data-rendered-state`, `data-treatment`) on a screen-reader-traversed `<p>`. Over-instrumented for a hero element.
**Why deferred:** Relocation requires updating the e2e tests that read these attributes (transition matrix, AC-4.3 tests). Mechanical but non-trivial; safer to do alongside the broader M9 polish pass.
**Suggested home:** M9 polish. Move test-only attributes onto a sibling `<span data-testid="right-now-debug" hidden>` outside the AT tree. Update e2e tests at the same time.

### M4-D5 — `--tracking-eyebrow` token consolidation

**Source:** M4 catch-up `/impeccable critique`, 2026-05-03 (Finding 7 LOW)
**Description:** Five different `tracking-[...]` values for uppercase eyebrows across Section + KeyValue + Header + RightNowCard + Footer (`0.12em` / `0.14em` / `0.18em` / `0.22em` / inline arbitrary values). Token-discipline contract violation — inline arbitrary values where a named token would unify the spec.
**Why deferred:** LOW finding; cosmetic. Easy to do but not blocking anything.
**Suggested home:** M9 polish. Add `--tracking-eyebrow` (and maybe `-eyebrow-strong`) to `app/globals.css` `@theme`, document in DESIGN.md §2, replace the 5 inline values.

### M4-D6 — `tests/e2e/crew-page.spec.ts:118` desktop-chromium viewport bug

**Source:** Task 4.13 spec compliance review, 2026-05-03 (pre-existing failure flagged)
**Description:** Task 4.2's `crew-page.spec.ts:118` test asserts 2-col grid without `setViewportSize(390, ...)`. On `desktop-chromium` (1280×800 default) the grid renders 4 cols, so the assertion fails. Pre-existing failure introduced at commit `c518006` (predates Task 4.13). The current `playwright.config.ts` testMatch may be excluding it from `desktop-chromium` — verify.
**Why deferred:** Not introduced by Task 4.13; pre-existing. Minor scope.
**Suggested home:** Next M4-touching change OR M9 polish. Either add `await page.setViewportSize({ width: 390, height: 667 })` at the top of the test, OR scope the test's testMatch to `mobile-safari` only.
