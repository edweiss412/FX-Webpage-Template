# CI unit-suite — overlap the Supabase boot with dependency setup

**Date:** 2026-07-20
**Predecessors:** P1 #504 (8-leg matrix, image-cache lever reverted on measurement), P2 #507 (12 dirs serial→parallel), P3 #510 (closed unmerged — file-granular membership measured no gain), #512 (resolved-config partition proof). Program doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/ci/2026-07-19-ci-unit-suite-under-5min.md`.

## 1. Goal

Cut per-leg wall clock by running the Supabase bootstrap CONCURRENTLY with the dependency-install step instead of after it. Target: **~16s off every leg**, the duration of the setup step that currently blocks the boot from starting.

### 1.1 Resolved scope — do not relitigate

| Decision | Ratification |
| --- | --- |
| Image caching is DEAD as a lever — measured on P1 as ~19s SLOWER than the registry pull (cache-hit boot median 92.5s vs 73.5s). Do not re-propose it here | P1 spec §6.1 outcome, PR #504 |
| Test-membership changes (which files run in which vitest project) are OUT of scope — P3 measured no wall-clock gain from them and was closed unmerged | PR #510, `BL-CI-P3-FILE-GRANULAR-SERIAL` |
| Shard count stays 8; the aggregator, its REQUIRED check name, and branch protection are untouched | P1 §5.1 |
| The bootstrap script's contents (held-aside migrations, GUC dance, `-x` service list, `SUPABASE_START_ATTEMPTS` retry) are UNCHANGED. This phase changes only WHEN it runs relative to other steps | this spec §3 |
| A pre-migrated/pre-baked Postgres image (removing the ~14s schema-init + migration phase) is out of scope: it needs a build-and-publish pipeline and a staleness contract, which is a larger change than this one | this spec §6 |

## 2. Measurement (current main, run 29741812457, leg 1)

| Step | Seconds |
| --- | --- |
| Set up job + checkout | 3 |
| `./.github/actions/setup` (pnpm install, warm cache) | **16** |
| `supabase/setup-cli@v1` | 2 |
| Install psql (guarded; preinstalled) | 0 |
| Boot local Supabase | **70** |
| vitest shard | 154 |

Boot-phase decomposition from that run's log: image pull ≈45s (first `Pulled` 12:20:31 → last 12:21:07), container start ≈11s (→ `Initialising schema...` 12:21:18), schema init ≈6s (→ `Seeding globals` 12:21:24), migrations ≈8s. Fixed overhead on this leg totals ~91s against a 245s max leg; the leg-MEDIAN fixed overhead across all 8 legs of the same run is 101s (per-leg: 89, 96, 98, 101, 101, 103, 105, 108), and §5 gates on that median rather than on any single leg.

**The observation this phase exploits:** the boot step cannot begin until `./.github/actions/setup` finishes, yet the two share no data. The boot's first ~45s is network-bound image pulling; the setup step's 16s is npm-registry-bound installing. Running them concurrently should reclaim most of the shorter one — bounded above by 16s, and possibly less under contention (§3); §5 measures rather than assumes, and the gate reverts a change that does not pay.

### 2.1 Empirical probe (run 29743206592, 2026-07-20) — the design's undocumented premises, measured

Whether a process detached in one step survives into later steps on a GitHub-hosted runner is undocumented runner behaviour, and the whole design rests on it. Per this project's spike rule it was PROBED, not assumed, before this design was written down. A throwaway workflow started a detached worker that slept 40s then published a status, ran a 20s step in between, and joined:

| Probe question | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Detached process survives across step boundaries? | **YES** — worker started 12:42:09, its output and sentinel appeared at 12:42:49, read by a later step's shell |
| Sentinel status propagates to the joining step? | **YES** — status 7 written, 7 observed |
| Is `echo N > file` observably non-atomic to a concurrent reader? | **0 empty reads in 400 create/read races** |

The first two make the design viable. The third says the empty-read race is not observable in practice — but 0/400 is not proof of impossibility, and the fix is free, so §3 publishes the sentinel with a `mv` (atomic rename within one filesystem) rather than relying on it.

## 3. Design

Reorder and background, changing no script. **The cross-step coordination is a completion sentinel, not a PID** — a `run:` step is its own shell, so a later step cannot `wait` on an earlier step's child (`wait` on a non-child returns non-zero, which would fail every leg permanently). Status must be persisted to the filesystem, which outlives the step shell.

1. `actions/checkout@v4` (unchanged, must be first — the composite action and the bootstrap both live in the repo).
2. `supabase/setup-cli@v1` moves UP, before the setup composite (2s; the bootstrap needs the CLI on PATH).
3. Install psql moves UP for the same reason (0s in practice, guarded).
4. **NEW — start the bootstrap detached, writing a sentinel on completion:**

   ```bash
   rm -f /tmp/supabase-boot.rc /tmp/supabase-boot.rc.tmp /tmp/supabase-boot.log
   date +%s > /tmp/supabase-boot.started
   nohup bash -c '
     bash scripts/ci/supabase-local-bootstrap.sh
     rc=$?
     echo "$rc" > /tmp/supabase-boot.rc.tmp
     mv /tmp/supabase-boot.rc.tmp /tmp/supabase-boot.rc
   ' > /tmp/supabase-boot.log 2>&1 &
   disown
   ```

   The inner capture records the bootstrap's real exit status, published by `mv` so the join can never observe a created-but-empty sentinel (§2.1 probe question 3). Background survival across steps is not an assumption here — it is measured in §2.1.

5. `./.github/actions/setup` runs while images pull.
6. **NEW — join: wait for the sentinel, surface the log, adopt the status.**

   ```bash
   # Anchor the deadline to when the BOOT started, not when the join did, so a
   # slow setup step cannot push the effective timeout past the 20-minute job cap.
   started=$(cat /tmp/supabase-boot.started)
   deadline=$(( started + 600 ))
   while [ ! -f /tmp/supabase-boot.rc ]; do
     if [ "$(date +%s)" -ge "$deadline" ]; then
       echo "::error::supabase bootstrap did not finish within 600s of starting"
       cat /tmp/supabase-boot.log || true
       exit 1
     fi
     sleep 2
   done
   # Print the log on EVERY path, before the status is consulted — a regression
   # that logs only when rc=0 would hide the output exactly when it is needed.
   cat /tmp/supabase-boot.log
   rc=$(cat /tmp/supabase-boot.rc)
   echo "bootstrap exit status: $rc"
   exit "$rc"
   ```

   `exit "$rc"` is the fail-closed hinge: a non-zero bootstrap fails the leg and therefore the REQUIRED aggregate, exactly as the foreground form does. The start step records the boot start time (date +%s) to a started-marker file under /tmp; the join's 600s deadline is measured from THAT, so a slow setup cannot push the effective timeout past the job's 20-minute cap (round-2 finding 6). The single `|| true` is on the diagnostic `cat` in the timeout path ONLY, where the log may legitimately not exist yet; it can never mask a bootstrap failure because that path exits 1 unconditionally.

7. vitest step unchanged.

**Diagnostics on failure paths (round-1 finding 7).** Today the boot log streams live; buffering it until the join would hide it whenever setup fails, the job is cancelled, or the runner times out before the join. An **`if: failure()` log-dump step** placed after the setup composite prints whatever the boot has produced when SETUP fails. Honest limits (round-2 finding 6): it cannot help on job cancellation or a runner-level timeout, where no later step runs at all — those paths lose the buffered log, which is a real if narrow regression versus today's streaming. The join prints the log on both its success and timeout paths.

**Working-tree interleaving (round-1 finding 3).** The bootstrap moves two migration files aside and restores them via `trap restore EXIT`, while `pnpm install` runs concurrently. Disjointness is AUDITED, not inferred from the top-level command (round-2 finding 5): `package.json` defines exactly one install-lifecycle script, `prepare: simple-git-hooks`, whose configuration is `{"pre-commit": "pnpm exec lint-staged"}` — it writes `.git/hooks/` only. No `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, or `prepack` exists. So the concurrent writes are `node_modules/` plus `.git/hooks/` against `supabase/migrations/*.sql`: disjoint. If the job dies between the move and the trap, the mutated tree is discarded with the ephemeral runner — no persistence risk, and no other step reads those files before the join.

**Expected saving — bounded, not asserted.** Contention-free, `16 + 70` becomes `max(16, 70)`, i.e. 16s. But the setup step is not purely network-bound: with `cache: pnpm` it also restores a cache, links/extracts packages, and runs package scripts, competing with Docker layer extraction for disk and CPU. **16s is an upper bound; the realized saving may be materially less.** §5 measures rather than assumes.

## 4. Meta-test inventory (mandatory declaration)

EXTENDS `tests/cross-cutting/unit-suite-shard-topology.test.ts`. CREATES none.

(a) **Step ordering**: checkout → setup-cli → psql → background-start → setup composite → join → vitest, by index comparison.
(b) **Executable behavioral proof of the join, plus structural pins for what execution cannot observe.** Round-2 review showed two exit-code trials are necessary but NOT sufficient — several regressions preserve both codes while destroying the point of the change. The proof is therefore layered:

   **Executed** (extract the start and join `run:` bodies from the YAML, run them in a temp dir against a stub bootstrap under `bash -euo pipefail`, matching Actions' shell):
   - stub exits 0 → join exits 0 (a successful boot lets the leg continue);
   - stub exits 7 → join exits 7 (a failed boot fails the leg — the fail-closed hinge);
   - stub never writes a sentinel, with the deadline stubbed short → join exits non-zero and prints the timeout error (the missing-sentinel branch, invisible to the first two trials). Isolation (round-3 finding 5): the trial rewrites the extracted bodies' absolute boot-file paths under /tmp to per-test temp paths so concurrent runs cannot collide, and simulates the missing sentinel by never creating it rather than by leaving a worker hanging, so no detached process is orphaned;
   - the stub's stdout appears in the join's output on the success path (log surfacing, likewise invisible to exit codes).
   Running under `-euo pipefail` closes the round-2 gap where a lax shell lets an intermediate failure precede the expected final `exit`.

   **Structural** (things execution in a local shell cannot prove, since it cannot reproduce runner step boundaries):
   - the start step's command contains `nohup` and a trailing `&` — without detachment the "overlap" silently becomes sequential while both exit-code trials still pass, i.e. the change would be a no-op that looks correct;
   - the start step does NOT itself wait for the bootstrap;
   - the START step publishes the sentinel via the `.rc.tmp` + `mv` form, not a bare redirect into the path the join reads;
   - the START step writes the boot-start marker, and the JOIN computes its deadline from that marker rather than from its own start — a regression to `join_time + timeout` restores the job-cap defect while passing all four executed trials (round-3 finding 3);
   - an `if: failure()` log-dump step exists after the setup composite — deleting it survives every trial and a green acceptance run (round-3 finding 4).
(c) **The bootstrap is invoked exactly once** in the workflow, still as `bash scripts/ci/supabase-local-bootstrap.sh` (the shared-script contract other workflows depend on).
(d) **Soft-failure inventory**: `|| true` appears exactly once, on the timeout path's diagnostic `cat` (§3.6), and never on the bootstrap invocation or the join's exit.
(e) Unchanged and must stay green: the 8-leg matrix + denominator pins, the no-`continue-on-error` guard, the aggregator name/`needs`/`if: always()` pins, `tests/cross-cutting/ci-workflow-speedup.test.ts`.

## 5. Accept criteria (real CI)

1. All 8 legs + aggregator green, and the boot log is present in each leg's job output (backgrounding must not hide it).
2. Measure with P1's `measure()` (`LEGS=8`). The comparison is **leg-median fixed overhead** — `(job wall) − (vitest step)`, which isolates what this phase actually changes — not max leg alone, whose noise is dominated by test distribution.
3. **Accept** if the leg-median fixed overhead drops by **≥8s** versus the main baseline computed the SAME way AND all legs are green. **Revert** otherwise. The 8s floor is deliberately half the theoretical 16s: it demands a real effect while tolerating the contention §3 predicts, and it is far enough from zero that runner noise cannot manufacture it. A one-second difference is not a gain (round-1 finding 6).
4. Record both the median fixed overhead and max leg in the PR body either way, so a revert is as legible as an accept.

## 6. Out of scope

- Image caching (§1.1, measured dead on P1).
- A pre-baked/pre-migrated Postgres image removing the ~14s schema+migration phase — a larger change needing a publish pipeline and staleness contract; note it as the next lever if this one lands.
- Trimming the `-x` service list further (each remaining service is exercised; documented in the bootstrap).
- Any change to test membership, shard count, or the bootstrap script's body.

## 7. Numeric self-consistency register

Baseline run 29741812457 leg 1: setup 16s, setup-cli 2s, boot 70s, vitest 154s, leg-1 fixed overhead 91s, leg-median fixed overhead 101s, max leg 245s (§2); boot decomposition pull ≈45s / start ≈11s / schema ≈6s / migrations ≈8s (§2); theoretical upper-bound saving 16s → overhead ~75s (§3); accept threshold ≥8s median fixed-overhead reduction vs the 101s median baseline (§5.3); join deadline 600s from boot start (§3.6); probe run 29743206592, 0/400 empty reads (§2.1).
