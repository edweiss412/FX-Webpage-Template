# Spec — BL-ADMIN-OUTCOME-BEHAVIOR Batch 2: 16 clean DI-seam admin route POSTs

**Date:** 2026-07-09
**Slug:** `admin-outcome-behavior-batch2`
**Backlog item:** BL-ADMIN-OUTCOME-BEHAVIOR (orchestrator-tracked)
**This PR = Batch 2 of the batched ratchet** (Batch 1 = PR #365, pin 30→24). Blast radius: **test-only** — extends `tests/log/adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts` and shrinks `ADMIN_OUTCOME_BEHAVIOR_GRANDFATHER` in `tests/log/mutationSurface/exemptions.ts`. No production code, no UI, no DB, no advisory-locks.

---

## 1. Background

AGENTS.md **invariant #10** (landed PR #306): every admin mutation surface needs registry membership in `AUDITABLE_MUTATIONS` **plus** an executable success-branch behavioral proof — a sink-spy in `tests/log/adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts` that records `${file}::${fn}::${code}` into a file-local `recorded` set **only after** observing the code emitted on the committed-success branch (via the **real** logger + `setLogSink`; the file forbids mocking `@/lib/log`). **Task 18** asserts every non-grandfathered admin `AUDITABLE_MUTATIONS` row has a `recorded` entry.

`ADMIN_OUTCOME_BEHAVIOR_GRANDFATHER` is a **frozen, hardcoded** baseline that only shrinks as surfaces graduate to inline proof. After Batch 1 it holds **24 route POSTs** (pin `.length === 24` in `adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts` and `exemptions.test.ts`).

## 2. Goal & closure strategy

Graduate the **16 clean DI-seam** admin route POSTs — those whose `route.ts` exports a testable seam `handle*(request, [context], routeDeps = {})` returning a `Response`, and whose committed-success branch is reachable by injecting an in-memory mutation dep / faked transaction (no real Supabase) — into inline `observeSuccessCodes` proofs, then delete their grandfather rows and drop the pin **24 → 8**.

### Batch re-cut by difficulty (refines the Batch-1 spec's 20/4 table)

Batch 1's spec sketched Batch 2 = "all 20 DI-seam routes." A live-code pass split the 20 by injection difficulty. The 4 heaviest DI-seam routes need a full in-memory harness or a hand-faked multi-query tx and are deferred to **Batch 3** alongside the 4 plain-POST routes:

| Batch | Route files | Difficulty | Pin after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (PR #365) | 6 per-show server actions | Low | 30 → 24 |
| **2 (this PR)** | **16 clean DI-seam route POSTs** (mutation dep or simple faked-tx, each with an existing DB-independent driver test) | Medium | 24 → **8** |
| 3 | 4 heavy DI-seam (`approve` DB-backed-only, `finalize`, `finalize-cas`, `extract-agenda`) + 4 plain-POST (`staged/[fileId]/apply`, `sync/[slug]`, `snapshot-rollback/[id]/repair`, `staged/[fileId]/discard`) | High | 8 → 0 |

Batch 3 gets its own spec/plan/PR. At pin 0, the grandfather array + its pin test are deleted and Task 18 covers every admin surface strictly.

## 3. Batch 2 — the 16 clean DI-seam routes

All 16 handlers gate on `requireAdminIdentity` **injected via `routeDeps`** — EXCEPT `rescan-sheet`, which calls a module-level `requireAdmin()` already satisfied by the file's existing `vi.mock("@/lib/auth/requireAdmin")` (`adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts:34-38`). The success emit is always a post-commit `logAdminOutcome({ code, ... })` on the committed branch; the paired failure returns a non-committing outcome so the code is absent.

### 3.1 Surfaces, codes, and drive recipe

Registry rows live in `tests/log/_auditableMutations.ts`; existing real-sink / faked-dep driver tests give the exact injection shape. `[wsid]`=`[wizardSessionId]`, `[dfid]`=`[driveFileId]`. Every file is `app/api/admin/<path>/route.ts`, `fn:"POST"`.

DEFERRED/IGNORED: `handleWizardPendingIngestionAction(ctx,deps,"defer_until_modified"\|"permanent_ignore")` + faked `withRowTx` whose callback commits (manifest transitioned, deferral written, pending-ingestion deleted) so `committedAction` is set → emit `route.ts:526` | retry `{outcome:"wizard_superseded"}`. **defer/ignore: DB-free — see §3.3 (inject non-committing `withRowTx` OR rollback + faked `upsertAdminAlert`/`readCurrentWizardSessionId`)** | `tests/onboarding/pendingIngestionsWizardActions.test.ts:144` |

**16 grandfather units → 18 `recorded` rows** (route #14 carries 3 codes; the other 15 carry 1 each — `admin-alerts/[id]/resolve` and `show/[slug]/alerts/[id]/resolve` each independently record `ADMIN_ALERT_RESOLVED` under their own file key). All codes are pre-existing SHOUTY producers — no new §12.4 codes.

### 3.2 Inline mock recipe (added to `adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts`)

The file already mocks `@/lib/auth/requireAdmin`, `@/lib/supabase/server` (swappable `serverClientImpl.current`), `next/cache`, `next/navigation`, and provides `setLogSink`-based `observeSuccessCodes` / `observeCodes` helpers + the file-local `recordAdminOutcomeBehavior`. Batch 2 adds **no module `vi.mock`s** — each route handler is driven by passing a per-test `routeDeps` object literal (mutation dep / faked-tx) directly as the handler's last argument, plus `requireAdminIdentity` in `routeDeps` (default `async () => ({ email: "admin@example.com" })`). `context` is `{ params: Promise.resolve({ ... }) }`. This keeps the additions inert for existing tests (no shared module mock introduced).

**Faked-tx helper.** Routes #3, #9, #10, #11, #12, #20 (and #13/#14's tx legs) drive a `withTx`/`withRowTx`/`withRowTryLock` seam whose callback receives a `tx` with `queryOne`/`run`. Add ONE small local `fakeTx(overrides)` helper in the Batch-2 describe block (returns a `tx` object whose `queryOne`/`run` resolve the per-route committed shape) rather than per-test duplication. The helper is scoped to the Batch-2 block; it does not touch existing tests.

### 3.3 Per-surface test shape

For each route, one `test(...)` inside a new `describe("Batch 2 — clean DI-seam admin route POSTs observe success only")`:

- **Success:** build `routeDeps` (mutation dep / `fakeTx`) that reaches the committed branch + `context` with resolved `params`; drive `observeSuccessCodes(() => handler(request, context, routeDeps))`; assert the code observed; `recordAdminOutcomeBehavior({ file, fn: "POST", code })`. `request` is a minimal `new Request("https://x/", { method: "POST", body })` shaped to what the handler reads (most read only `params`/deps; #9/#10/#15/#18 may read a JSON body — supply the minimal valid body).
- **Failure/refusal (paired, non-tautology):** the mutation dep / tx returns a non-committing outcome (per §3.1 "failure" column); drive `observeCodes`; assert the code **absent**. Proves the record is committed-success-gated, not unconditional.

**Route #18 (`onboarding/scan`) is STREAMING — special-cased.** `handleOnboardingScan` returns an NDJSON `ReadableStream` `Response` and emits `ONBOARDING_SCAN_COMPLETED` **inside** `stream.start()` (`route.ts:277`), which runs only when the body is consumed — AFTER the handler promise resolves. `observeSuccessCodes` resets the sink the moment its `run()` callback resolves, so a bare `observeSuccessCodes(() => handleOnboardingScan(req, deps))` would reset the sink before the emit fires (missing the code / flaky on microtask timing). Drive it as:

```
const codes = await observeSuccessCodes(async () => {
  const res = await handleOnboardingScan(scanRequest, scanDeps);
  await drainNdjson(res); // read the stream to completion so start()'s emit runs
});
```

where `drainNdjson` reads `res.body` to EOF — mirror the local `readNdjson` helper at `tests/onboarding/scanRoute.test.ts:143` (add a small equivalent in the Batch-2 block, or read `await res.text()`). The paired **failure** case (`runOnboardingScan`→`{outcome:"failed"|...}`) must ALSO drain the body under `observeCodes` before asserting `ONBOARDING_SCAN_COMPLETED` is absent — otherwise the absence is trivially true because the stream never ran. (No other Batch-2 route streams — verified: `onboarding/scan` is the only `ReadableStream` responder in the 16.)

Route #14 records **three** codes: one success drive of `handleWizardPendingIngestionRetry` (→`PENDING_INGESTION_RETRIED`) and two drives of `handleWizardPendingIngestionAction(ctx, deps, "defer_until_modified")` / `("permanent_ignore")` (→`PENDING_INGESTION_DEFERRED` / `PENDING_INGESTION_IGNORED`), each recorded under the SAME file key `app/api/admin/onboarding/pending_ingestions/[id]/retry/route.ts::POST`. Do NOT drive the sibling `defer_until_modified/` / `permanent_ignore/` delegator routes — those record under their own file paths and remain `ADMIN_SURFACE_EXEMPTIONS` delegators.

**#14 defer/ignore success + failure drives are DB-free by construction (Codex spec-R3 MED).** The `WizardPendingIngestionRouteDeps` seam (`route.ts:46-47`) exposes `upsertAdminAlert` and `readCurrentWizardSessionId` as injectable — the live rollback branch (`route.ts:549-562`) calls their **Supabase-backed defaults** unless injected, so any drive that reaches the `WizardSessionSupersededRollbackError` catch MUST inject both. Concretely:

- **Success (emit present):** inject a `withRowTx = (_id, fn) => fn(tx)` whose `tx` returns the committed shape (manifest transitioned, deferral written, pending-ingestion deleted) so the callback sets `committedAction` and the post-tx `logAdminOutcome` at `route.ts:526` fires. No alert deps are reached on the committed branch.
- **Failure (emit absent) — pick ONE; both INVOKE the real callback and are explicitly DB-free:**
  1. **Callback-invoking pre-mutation refusal (preferred):** inject `withRowTx = (_id, fn) => fn(tx)` (invokes the callback, production-shaped) with a faked `tx` whose locked-row read returns `null`, so `requireCurrentWizardRow(tx, id)` returns its `{ ok: false, response: 404 PENDING_INGESTION_NOT_FOUND }` (`route.ts:209-210`). The callback returns that non-committing response BEFORE any mutation → `committedAction` never set → no emit at `route.ts:526`. Because it returns (not throws), the `WizardSessionSupersededRollbackError` catch and its alert deps are never reached → no alert-dep injection needed, fully DB-free, yet it exercises `requireCurrentWizardRow` and the real callback entry.
  2. **Real rollback branch:** inject `withRowTx = (_id, fn) => fn(tx)` whose faked `tx` drives a 0-row mutating outcome so the callback throws `WizardSessionSupersededRollbackError` (`route.ts:483-487`), **and** inject `upsertAdminAlert: async () => null` + `readCurrentWizardSessionId: async () => null` (matching the existing telemetry driver) so the catch (`route.ts:549-562`) stays DB-free while exercising the real no-emit rollback path.

Do NOT (a) use a `withRowTx` that resolves WITHOUT invoking the callback — that bypasses `requireCurrentWizardRow` and the real defer/ignore refusal logic, so the absence proof is hollow; nor (b) leave `upsertAdminAlert`/`readCurrentWizardSessionId` at their Supabase defaults while hitting the rollback catch — that touches real Supabase.

### 3.4 Grandfather removal + pin

Delete the 16 route rows from `ADMIN_OUTCOME_BEHAVIOR_GRANDFATHER` (`exemptions.ts`), leaving **8** (the 4 heavy DI-seam + 4 plain-POST route POSTs for Batch 3). Update the pins `toBe(24)` → `toBe(8)` at `adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts:1443` (Task 18a) and `exemptions.test.ts:31` (`.length`) + `:33` (Set size). Update `exemptions.test.ts:37`'s `routeRows.length` assertion `24` → `8`. Update the doc-comment in `exemptions.ts` (keep "frozen, never grows"; note Batch 2 graduated the 16 clean DI-seam routes → 8 remain: 4 heavy DI-seam + 4 plain-POST). Update the Batch-1 pin-test title to reflect the new pin.

## 4. Guard conditions / edge cases

- **`params` is a Promise** in Next 16 route contexts. Every `context` literal must use `params: Promise.resolve({...})`, matching the handlers' `await context.params`.
- **Handlers reading a request body** (#9 ignore, #10 unignore, #15 rescan, #18 scan may parse JSON). Supply the minimal valid body; if the handler tolerates an empty body via deps, prefer deps. Cite the driver test's body shape.
- **`ADMIN_ALERT_RESOLVED` shared across #11/#12.** Distinct file keys → two distinct `recorded` entries; both required. A single drive does not satisfy both.
- **`STAGE_DISCARDED` shared across #4/#17.** Same — two file keys, two records.
- **#20 unconditional emit.** `ignored-sheets/unignore` emits after `withRowTx` resolves regardless of rows affected; its failure case must make `withRowTx` THROW (→ the `*_UNIGNORE_FAILED` catch path) to prove absence, since there is no "no-op success" branch.
- **#15 rescan gate.** Uses module `requireAdmin()` (already mocked), not `routeDeps.requireAdminIdentity`; do not inject an identity dep it doesn't read.
- **#18 scan is a streaming responder.** Its `ONBOARDING_SCAN_COMPLETED` emit runs inside `ReadableStream.start()` (`route.ts:277`) only when the body is consumed. BOTH the success (`observeSuccessCodes`) and failure (`observeCodes`) drives MUST drain the response body before returning (per §3.3), or the success proof misses the code and the failure proof is trivially/falsely "absent." This is the one Batch-2 route whose drive is not the plain `handler(...)` call.
- **Shared-mock hygiene (from Batch 1 rebase).** Do not introduce a module `vi.mock` for anything already mocked in the file; Batch 2 uses direct `routeDeps` injection precisely to avoid that class. `beforeEach` runs `vi.clearAllMocks()` (does not restore impls) — Batch 2 tests are self-contained (per-test `routeDeps` literals), so no cross-test mock bleed.

## 5. Negative-regression proofs (the contract has teeth)

Momentary manual checks during implementation (restore after):

1. Leave the pin at `24` after removing 16 rows → Task 18a pin test RED (`24 !== 8`).
2. Remove one `recordAdminOutcomeBehavior` call → Task 18 coverage test RED, naming the exact `file::fn::code` now unproven.
3. Drop a paired failure assertion / make a success case emit unconditionally → the paired `observeCodes` "code absent" assertion RED, proving success-gating.

## 6. Watchpoints (pre-load the reviewer)

- **DO NOT RELITIGATE** the batch re-cut (16 clean / 4 heavy+4 plain). It is a difficulty refinement of the Batch-1 spec's explicit "Batches 2 & 3 get their own specs" clause (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-05-admin-outcome-behavioral-coverage-registry.md:36`), not a scope contradiction. The 4 deferred DI-seam routes are named with their reason (harness / DB-backed-only proof).
- **DO NOT RELITIGATE** using direct `routeDeps` injection instead of module `vi.mock`s — this is the deliberate mechanism to keep additions inert and dodge the Batch-1 shared-mock collision class.
- Test-only; no `pg_advisory*`, no new §12.4 code, no Supabase call-boundary surface, no meta-test created (EXTENDS `adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts` + edits `exemptions.ts` registry data).

## 7. Live-code citation ledger (verified against the tree at `origin/main` = `2ee9f5c9e`)

Every factual code claim in §3 is pinned here to `file:line`. `AM` = `tests/log/_auditableMutations.ts`; each route file is `app/api/admin/<path>/route.ts`. The `routeDeps` type name for each route is declared inline on its handler-signature line (imported from the route's own module or an adjacent `_deps`/lib file).

**Structural citations:**

- Grandfather array (16 rows to remove + 8 that remain): `tests/log/mutationSurface/exemptions.ts` (the `ADMIN_OUTCOME_BEHAVIOR_GRANDFATHER` literal).
- Pins to flip `24`→`8`: `adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts:1443` (Task 18a) and `exemptions.test.ts:31` (`.length`), `:33` (Set size), `:37` (`routeRows.length`).
- `requireAdmin`/`requireAdminIdentity` mock (satisfies #15's module gate + provides the injected-identity default shape): `adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts:34` (`vi.mock("@/lib/auth/requireAdmin", …)`).
- File-local recorder + observe helpers: `recordAdminOutcomeBehavior` / `observeSuccessCodes` / `observeCodes` in `adminOutcomeBehavior.test.ts` (Batch-1 infrastructure, reused verbatim).
- Existing driver tests (injection recipe per route) are cited inline in §3.1's "existing driver" column; those are the copy-source for the `routeDeps`/`fakeTx` shapes, not runtime dependencies of this batch.
- Handler-signature verification note: `apply`(#1), `unapprove`(#3), `discard`(#4), `live-staged apply`(#7), `live-retry`(#8), `ignore`(#9), `unignore`(#10), `alert global/show resolve`(#11/#12), `live-discard`(#13), `cleanup`(#16), `live-staged discard`(#17), `extract-agenda`-family, `ignored-sheets unignore`(#20) take `(request, context, routeDeps = {})`; `finalize`/`finalize-cas`/`rescan`(#15)/`scan`(#18) take **no `context`** (`(request, routeDeps)` / `(request, deps?)`) — verified from the handler-signature lines above. Test drives must match (omit `context` for #15/#18).
