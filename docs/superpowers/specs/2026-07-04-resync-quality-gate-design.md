# Re-sync Quality Gate — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-07-04
**Author:** Opus / Claude Code (autonomous ship)
**Audit source:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-30-fxav-crew-pages-v1/edge-case-preparedness-audit-2026-07-04.md` finding #3 / §5 recommendation #2 (work item #2 of 6).
**Worktree/branch:** `/Users/ericweiss/fxav-worktrees/resync-quality-gate` · `feat/resync-quality-gate`

---

## 1. Problem

A re-sync of an **existing, already-published** show currently auto-applies with full-replace semantics regardless of how much data the new parse lost. Audit finding #3 (the highest-severity data-loss vector):

> **Re-sync shrinkage auto-clobbers live data — newest sheet always wins.** `lib/sync/phase1.ts:333-344` (MI-6..14 = notify-only); `applyParseResult.ts:128-135` (unconditional `deleteCrewMembersNotIn` + `replaceRooms/Hotels/...`). Plausible trigger: Doug deletes/moves a block mid-edit; sync fires between keystrokes. Live show overwritten. MI-6 crew shrink has no panel warning; only a passive `DataQualityBadge`.

The **detection already exists**: `runInvariants` (`lib/parser/invariants.ts:250-326`) computes `MI-6` (crew shrink `crewDrop > 1`) and `MI-7` (section shrink `nc < pc/2 || pc <= 2` for hotels/rooms/contacts, or transportation populated→null). The bug is purely **routing**: PF34 (`lib/sync/phase1.ts:333-345`) filters those triggered items down to `MI-11` only for existing shows; `MI-6`/`MI-7`/`MI-7b`/asset-drift are dropped, the pipeline falls through to `outcome: "pass"` (`phase1.ts:414`), and `applyParseResult` full-replaces the live rows.

## 2. Goal

Promote **count-based material shrinkage** (`MI-6` crew, `MI-7` section) on an existing published show from **notify-only auto-apply → staged-for-review**, so the live show retains last-good until an admin approves (accept the smaller roster) or rejects (keep last-good). This is audit recommendation #2 verbatim: *"Promote MI-6/MI-7 shrinkage from notify-only to staged-for-review."*

**Non-goal (explicitly out of scope):** a general "new parse materially worse than last-good" comparator (audit lists this as *"consider…"*, optional). `MI-6`/`MI-7` **are** the comparator; a second one is YAGNI. De-literalizing anchors is work item #3. MI-7b behavior change is excluded (§6).

## 3. Resolved decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| D1 | **Stage-for-review**, not alert-only. | An alert-only fix (audit's *"at minimum"*) fires **after** `applyParseResult` has already `deleteCrewMembersNotIn`'d the live rows — it reports the loss, it does not prevent it. Staging is the only option that actually stops the clobber. |
| D2 | **Reuse the existing `existing_staged` machinery**; add **no** new schema and **no** new admin-alert code. (One new §12.4 *message* code — `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED`, §4c — is the sole catalog addition, for the combined-case approve refusal.) | `pending_syncs` already supports existing-show rows (no `show_id` FK; keyed on `drive_file_id`; `20260501001000_internal_and_admin.sql:138-183`). The staging write path already branches on `show` existence (`phase1.ts:397-399` calls `updateShowPendingReview`). The `existing_staged` inbox variant (`lib/admin/needsAttention.ts:102,315`), digest push (`lib/notify/digest.ts:97` → "Changes staged for review"), per-show `?review=` surface, `applyStagedCore` UPDATE path, and `discardStaged` reject variants are all live and tested. `MI-6_CREW_SHRINKAGE` / `MI-7_SECTION_SHRINKAGE` already have §12.4 catalog rows (`lib/messages/catalog.ts:706,719`) and generated codes (`spec-codes.ts:527,533`). |
| D3 | **Gate `MI-6` and `MI-7` only**; leave `MI-7b`, `MI-11`, and asset-drift in their current lanes. | `MI-6`/`MI-7` are count-based **material** shrinkage (the audit's exact target). `MI-7b` (keyed preservation, `invariants.ts:329-360`) fires on **any benign room/hotel/contact rename** (memory `feedback_parser_rename_restages_via_mi7b`: "any rename re-stages once") — gating it would re-create the exact review-backlog problem the PF34 cutover eliminated. `MI-11` (email identity change) correctly routes to per-crew `sync_holds`. Asset drift is notify-only by design. |
| D4 | **ALL material-shrinkage stages — including MI-11 co-occurrence — so last-good is preserved in every case.** When `MI-6`/`MI-7` fire on an existing show, the whole parse stages regardless of `MI-11`. The staged row **persists any co-occurring `MI-11` items** so the existing fail-closed guard protects approval (see below). Only when there is NO shrinkage does an `MI-11`-only parse continue to `auto_apply_with_holds` (unchanged). | The audit goal is "no shrink clobber," so the combined shrink+email case must NOT auto-apply (that still full-replaces via `applyParseResult` — Codex R2 finding). Staging preserves last-good. The staged-**apply** path is **fail-closed on `MI-11`**: `applyStaged.ts:1257-1266` (`P2-F7`) `throw`s `Phase2GateBypassError` when a staged row carries an `MI-11` item (the legacy whole-parse apply would call `runPhase2` with `mi11Items: []` → email applies ungated). By persisting the `MI-11` items in the staged row, approval of a combined parse is fail-closed — no clobber, no ungated email. The apply route catches the throw and returns the dedicated cataloged `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED` code (§4c) so the admin sees a clean "keep the current version" message, not a 500. Primary resolution: reject/`defer_until_modified`. Completing approve-with-holds for the combined case (persist + convert `MI-11` → holds, reversing `P2-F7`) is `BL-RESYNC-STAGE-MI11-HOLDS` (§13). |
| D5 | **Scope to existing shows only** (`show != null`). | `MI-6`/`MI-7` require a prior snapshot and return early when `prior === null` (`invariants.ts:238`), so they can never fire first-seen. The `!show` auto-publish branch (`phase1.ts:354-370`) is disjoint. |
| D6 | **Existing-show reject supports `defer_until_modified` only** (plus the existing `try_again`); `permanent_ignore` stays **invalid** for existing shows. | A rejected shrink must not re-stage the same sheet (Finding 2), which `defer_until_modified` solves (watermark → skip until `modifiedTimeAdvanced`). `permanent_ignore` is an **unconditional** skip until manually cleared (`runScheduledCronSync.ts:2147-2148`) — it could permanently freeze a published show's auto-updates (Codex R2 finding), a broader behavior with no use case here. The reject route already forwards `defer_until_modified` (`app/api/admin/show/staged/[stagedId]/discard/route.ts:41-82`); the consumer is `drive_file_id`-keyed and show-agnostic (`runScheduledCronSync.ts:2150-2152`). Only the **write** side is blocked — `discardStaged.ts:504-505` refuses non-`try_again` when a show exists. §4b enables `defer_until_modified` there and keeps `permanent_ignore` rejected for existing shows. |

## 4. Architecture — the behavioral change

The primary production change is in `runPhase1` (`lib/sync/phase1.ts`), narrowing the PF34 filter so material-shrinkage items on an existing show route into `triggeredReviewItems` (→ `upsertLivePendingSync`) instead of being dropped. A secondary change in `discardStaged` (§4b) makes the reject path defer-capable for existing shows so a rejected shrink cannot re-stage.

**Before** (`phase1.ts:337-345`):

```ts
const mi11Items = reviewItems.filter(
  (item): item is Extract<TriggeredReviewItem, { invariant: "MI-11" }> =>
    item.invariant === "MI-11",
);

// The staging branch (`upsertLivePendingSync`) is now reserved for SENTINELS + hard-fail ONLY [PF34].
let triggeredReviewItems: TriggeredReviewItem[] = sentinel ? [sentinel] : [];
```

**After:**

```ts
const mi11Items = reviewItems.filter(
  (item): item is Extract<TriggeredReviewItem, { invariant: "MI-11" }> =>
    item.invariant === "MI-11",
);

// Re-sync quality gate (audit finding #3): count-based MATERIAL shrinkage (MI-6 crew,
// MI-7 section) on an EXISTING published show stages the whole parse for review instead
// of auto-clobbering live data. MI-7b (benign renames) and asset drift stay notify-only —
// narrowing PF34, not reversing it. MI-6/MI-7 require a prior (invariants.ts:238), so
// `show` is always non-null when they fire; the `show &&` guard documents the scope.
const materialShrinkItems: TriggeredReviewItem[] = show
  ? reviewItems.filter(
      (item) => item.invariant === "MI-6" || item.invariant === "MI-7",
    )
  : [];

// When staging for shrinkage, PERSIST any co-occurring MI-11 items in the staged row so the
// fail-closed P2-F7 guard (applyStaged.ts:1264) protects approval — a combined shrink+email
// parse can never be approved into an ungated email apply. Last-good is preserved either way
// (approve is fail-closed → STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED; reject/defer keeps last-good). D4.
const stageForShrink = materialShrinkItems.length > 0;

let triggeredReviewItems: TriggeredReviewItem[] = [
  ...(sentinel ? [sentinel] : []),
  ...(stageForShrink ? [...materialShrinkItems, ...mi11Items] : []),
];
```

When `stageForShrink` is true the existing `triggeredReviewItems.length > 0` branch (`phase1.ts:372-401`) stages the parse via `upsertLivePendingSync`, calls `updateShowPendingReview` (existing-show path already present at `:397-399`), and returns `{ outcome: "stage", ... }`. When there is no shrinkage, `stageForShrink` is false; an `MI-11`-only parse then reaches `if (mi11Items.length > 0) return { outcome: "auto_apply_with_holds", mi11Items }` (`phase1.ts:406-408`) — unchanged.

### 4b. `discardStaged` — existing-show `defer_until_modified` (Finding 2 fix)

`lib/sync/discardStaged.ts` currently refuses any non-`try_again` reject when a show exists (`:504-505` → `INVALID_REVIEWER_ACTION`) and only writes a deferral on the `!show` branch (`:514-524`). The change: allow **`defer_until_modified`** for existing shows (keep `permanent_ignore` rejected — D6) and write the deferral in the `if (show)` branch (in addition to `restoreShowStatus`), so a rejected shrink watermarks `deferred_at_modified_time = stagedModifiedTime` and the cron consumer (`runScheduledCronSync.ts:2150-2152`) skips it until the sheet's `modifiedTime` advances. Concretely, replace the `show && variant !== "try_again"` blanket reject with `show && variant !== "try_again" && variant !== "defer_until_modified"`, and in the `if (show)` branch also call `upsertLiveDeferral({ deferredKind: "defer_until_modified", deferredAtModifiedTime: pending.stagedModifiedTime, ... })`. `try_again` for an existing show is unchanged (restore status + delete pending → re-processes next cron, which re-stages if the sheet is still shrunk — an explicit "retry now" choice).

**UI affordance:** the per-show `existing_staged` reject control must expose the `defer_until_modified` action ("Keep current version") in addition to `try_again`. The route already forwards it; only the UI needs the control. (Opus-owned per the UI-always-Opus rule; a one-control addition, no new layout/token surface — invariant-8 impeccable gate engaged at milestone close-out.)

### 4c. Apply route — graceful fail-closed on the combined case (Finding 1)

The live staged-apply route (`app/api/admin/show/staged/[stagedId]/apply/route.ts`) must catch `Phase2GateBypassError` (thrown by P2-F7 when a staged row carries an `MI-11` item) and return a **new dedicated cataloged code `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED`** — a clean fail-closed refusal, not a 500, with recovery copy that steers to the correct action (NOT the generic "refresh and try again" of `INVALID_REVIEWER_ACTION`, which would loop the admin). The staged row and last-good are left intact so the admin resolves via reject/`defer_until_modified` or a sheet fix. P2-F7 itself is unchanged (still fail-closed).

**New §12.4 message code** (admin/operator-facing; mirrors the `INVALID_REVIEWER_ACTION` catalog shape — `dougFacing`/`crewFacing` null, `adminSurface` per that peer):

- **Code:** `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED`
- **Admin-facing copy (recovery-oriented):** "This update also changes a crew member's email, so it can't be applied automatically. Keep the current version, or fix the sheet and re-sync."
- **Rendered by:** `StagedReviewCard` via `messageFor`/`ErrorExplainer` (through the catalog — no raw code in UI).
- **Lockstep (3-way + gates):** master spec §12.4 row + helpfulContext appendix → `pnpm gen:spec-codes` (`lib/messages/__generated__/spec-codes.ts`) → hand-authored producer in `lib/messages/catalog.ts` → `pnpm gen:internal-code-enums`. Plus: `app/help/errors/_families.ts` mapping (a staged/review family so "Other" stays empty), `tests/messages/codes*.test.ts` coverage/parity (x1/x2), and run the FULL `tests/messages` suite before push. (Same drill as `VERSION_AMBIGUOUS` in work item #1.)

**UI nicety (optional, in the UI task):** `StagedReviewCard` MAY additionally disable "Apply changes" for a row whose `triggeredReviewItems` contains an `MI-11` item and show the recovery note inline, so the refusal is proactive rather than post-click. The route-level code is the load-bearing contract; the disabled button is polish.

### Why every guard already holds

- **Debounce does not swallow it.** `mi8DebounceReason` (`phase1.ts:176`) returns `null` (no debounce) whenever any non-`MI-8`/`MI-8b` item is present. A parse with an `MI-6`/`MI-7` item never early-returns at `phase1.ts:330-331`.
- **Items are present in `reviewItems`.** When `runInvariants` returns `{ outcome: "stage", triggeredItems }` (`invariants.ts:811`), `phase1.ts:317-324` wraps them via `withLeadToggleSafetyNet` into `invariantItems`, which flow into `reviewItems` (`phase1.ts:329`). The filter finds them there.
- **Live rows preserved.** The stage branch never calls `applyParseResult`. `updateShowPendingReview` (`runScheduledCronSync.ts:834-838`) only sets `last_sync_status = 'pending_review'`; `crew_members`/`rooms`/`hotels`/`contacts` are untouched. The crew page keeps serving last-good.
- **`pending_review` is display-benign on a published show.** Consumed only by `StaleFooter` / `lib/admin/syncStatus.ts` / `driveConnectionHealth.ts` as a passive status tier — it does **not** unpublish or hide the crew page.

## 5. Data flow

```
cron re-sync (existing published show)
  → parseSheet → runInvariants(prior, next)
     ├─ MI-6/MI-7 shrink present (ANY MI-11)  → outcome:"stage", triggeredItems
     │     → phase1: materialShrinkItems (+ co-occurring MI-11) → upsertLivePendingSync
     │        → pending_syncs row (wizard_session_id NULL = LIVE)
     │        → updateShowPendingReview → shows.last_sync_status='pending_review'
     │        → live crew/rooms/hotels/contacts UNTOUCHED (last-good served)
     │     ── SIGNAL ──
     │        → Needs Attention inbox: variant "existing_staged" (needsAttention.ts:315)
     │        → notify digest push: "Changes staged for review" (digest.ts:97)
     │     ── REVIEW (admin, per-show ?review= surface) ──
     │        → APPROVE, no MI-11 in row  → applyStagedCore (UPDATE) → smaller parse applied
     │        → APPROVE, MI-11 in row     → P2-F7 fail-closed → route returns
     │                  STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED ("keep current version"); NO apply, NO clobber
     │        → REJECT ("Keep current version") → discardStaged(defer_until_modified)
     │                  → deferral watermark @ stagedModifiedTime → cron skips until
     │                    the sheet is edited again → NO re-stage loop
     └─ MI-11 only / asset drift / MI-7b       → auto-apply (unchanged)
```

## 6. Guard conditions & edge cases

| Case | Behavior | Where it's handled |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| `MI-6`/`MI-7` + `MI-11` in one parse | **Stages** (last-good preserved). Staged row persists the `MI-11` item, so **approve is fail-closed** (P2-F7 → route returns `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED`, "keep current version"); no apply, no clobber, no ungated email. Resolved by reject/`defer_until_modified` or a sheet fix (which re-evaluates to `auto_apply_with_holds` once crew is restored). | §4/§4c, D4; `applyStaged.ts:1264-1266`. |
| `MI-6`/`MI-7` + asset drift (no MI-11) | Whole parse stages; asset-drift feed rows not written this pass (re-derived on approve's apply). | Stage branch returns before asset-drift feed writes. |
| Repeated cron with same shrunk sheet (before reject) | `upsertLivePendingSync` upserts on `drive_file_id` (`runScheduledCronSync.ts:786`) → updates the existing staged row, no duplicate. | Existing upsert. |
| Admin rejects, Doug hasn't fixed sheet | Reject uses `defer_until_modified` → writes a deferral watermark at `stagedModifiedTime`; cron consumer (`runScheduledCronSync.ts:2150-2152`) skips until `modifiedTimeAdvanced`. No re-stage loop. When Doug edits again (new `modifiedTime`), it re-evaluates. | §4b `discardStaged` change + existing show-agnostic consumer. |
| Admin rejects with `try_again` (transient) | Restore status + delete pending → re-processes next cron; re-stages if still shrunk. Explicit "retry now" choice. | `discardStaged` `try_again` (unchanged). |
| Admin attempts `permanent_ignore` on an existing show | Rejected — `INVALID_REVIEWER_ACTION` (D6). Prevents permanently freezing a published show's auto-updates. | `discardStaged.ts:504-505` keeps `permanent_ignore` invalid for existing shows. |
| First-seen sheet with "shrinkage" | Impossible — `MI-6`/`MI-7` need a prior (`invariants.ts:238`). | `show` guard (D5). |
| `MI-7b` keyed rename (room renamed, count stable) | Auto-applies (notify-only) — unchanged. Avoids staging benign renames. | Excluded from filter (D3). |
| `MI-7` transportation populated→null | Stages (it is an `MI-7` item, `invariants.ts:317-325`). | Included by filter. |
| Legitimate large crew removal (Doug really cut 3 people) | Stages; admin approves → smaller roster applied. The "accept legit shrink" affordance is the whole point of staging over retain-last-good. | `applyStagedCore` approve path. |
| Published-lifecycle interaction (unpublish/republish while a live pending_sync exists) | Governed by the existing `existing_staged` machinery + publish gate; not newly introduced by this change. | Watchpoint — test coverage in §8. |

## 7. Blast radius

**Production files changed (4):**
1. `lib/sync/phase1.ts` — the routing narrowing; stage shrinkage (persisting co-occurring MI-11) (§4). ~10 lines.
2. `lib/sync/discardStaged.ts` — allow `defer_until_modified` (not `permanent_ignore`) for existing shows + write the deferral in the `show` branch (§4b). ~10 lines.
3. `app/api/admin/show/staged/[stagedId]/apply/route.ts` — catch `Phase2GateBypassError` → return the new `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED` code (§4c). ~5 lines.
4. The `existing_staged` review UI — expose the `defer_until_modified` ("Keep current version") reject action, and surface the combined-case approve refusal message (§4b/§4c). UI, Opus-owned.

**What does NOT change:**
- **No schema change.** `pending_syncs` and `deferred_ingestions` already hold existing-show rows; the deferral consumer is already `drive_file_id`-keyed and show-agnostic.
- **One new §12.4 message code: `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED`** (§4c) — the combined-case approve refusal. The shrink invariants themselves (`MI-6_CREW_SHRINKAGE`, `MI-7_SECTION_SHRINKAGE`) are already catalogued (`catalog.ts:706,719`; `spec-codes.ts:527,533`) and unchanged. The one new code goes through the full lockstep (spec §12.4 + `gen:spec-codes` + `catalog.ts` + `gen:internal-code-enums` + `_families.ts` + `tests/messages` coverage/x1/x2).
- **No new admin-alert code.** Staging signals via inbox + digest (existing copy). `_metaAdminAlertCatalog` untouched — the new code is a message/lookup code, not an `admin_alerts` lifecycle code.
- **No `applyParseResult` change.** The gate is upstream of apply.
- **No `runInvariants` change.** Detection thresholds reused as-is.
- **`applyStaged` P2-F7 fail-closed guard preserved** (not reversed). It is intentionally **provoked only on attempted approval** of a staged row carrying an `MI-11` item (D4): the throw is caught by the apply route and mapped to the dedicated cataloged refusal code (§4c). The combined-case phase1 staging test and the route-catch test are required coverage (§8.4-8.5).
- **No advisory-lock topology change.** `phase1` runs under the per-show `withShowLock` (`lib/sync/lockedShowTx.ts`, `hashtext('show:'||drive_file_id)`); `discardStaged` already owns its per-show lock/tx (`discardStaged.ts:101` comment). No new holder, no nesting. Meta-test `tests/auth/advisoryLockRpcDeadlock.test.ts` unaffected (no new SECURITY DEFINER function).

## 8. Testing strategy (TDD)

All new tests are unit/decision-rule level over the existing `phase1` fakes plus a DB-backed staging assertion; derive expectations from fixture dimensions (not hardcoded).

1. **Decision-rule: MI-6 crew shrink stages (existing show).** Prior 5 crew → next 2 crew (`crewDrop=3>1`); assert `outcome === "stage"`, `triggeredReviewItems` contains the `MI-6` item, and `upsertLivePendingSync` was called. Concrete failure it catches: a routing regression that drops `MI-6` back to auto-apply. (`tests/sync/phase1.decision-rule.test.ts`.)
2. **Decision-rule: MI-7 section shrink stages (existing show).** Prior 4 rooms → next 1 (`nc < pc/2`); assert staged. Also transportation populated→null stages.
3. **Decision-rule: benign drift still auto-applies.** (a) `MI-11`-only email change + crew **growth** → `outcome === "auto_apply_with_holds"`, NO live pending_sync (this is exactly the `cutover.retireLivePendingSyncs.test.ts:57` scenario — assert it stays green). (b) `MI-7b` rename with stable count → auto-applies, not staged. (c) crew drop of exactly 1 (`crewDrop=1`, not `>1`) → auto-applies. Failure it catches: over-staging benign renames / off-by-one on the `MI-6` threshold.
4. **Decision-rule: MI-11 co-occurrence STILL stages, persisting MI-11 (Finding 1).** Prior 5 crew with Alice@old → next 2 crew with Alice@new (`crewDrop=3>1` **and** an `MI-11` email change). Assert `outcome === "stage"`, the staged `triggeredReviewItems` contains BOTH an `MI-6` item AND the `MI-11` item, and NO clobber. Concrete failure it catches: routing the combined case to auto-apply (clobber) OR staging without the MI-11 item (which would let approve bypass the email gate).
5. **Combined-case approve is fail-closed (Finding 1, apply path).** Given a staged row carrying `MI-6`+`MI-11`, calling the live apply path throws `Phase2GateBypassError`; the route (`.../apply/route.ts`) returns `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED` (not a 500), and live crew rows are **unchanged** (no apply). Failure it catches: an ungated email apply / a data clobber / an uncaught 500 on approve.
6. **DB-backed staging integration.** Seed a published show + 5 crew; run the pipeline with a 2-crew parse (no email change); assert (a) a LIVE `pending_syncs` row exists (`wizard_session_id IS NULL`), (b) `shows.last_sync_status = 'pending_review'`, (c) the 5 live `crew_members` rows are **still present** (last-good retained, not clobbered). Failure it catches: the core data-loss bug — apply running despite the gate.
7. **Reject → defer → no re-stage loop (Finding 2).** DB-backed: stage an existing-show shrink; reject with `defer_until_modified`; assert a `deferred_ingestions` row exists with `deferred_at_modified_time = stagedModifiedTime`; then run the cron decision (deferral gate) against the SAME `modifiedTime` → `skipped (deferred_modtime)`; and against an ADVANCED `modifiedTime` → proceeds (re-evaluates). Also assert `discardStaged` accepts `defer_until_modified` for an existing show, and STILL returns `INVALID_REVIEWER_ACTION` for `permanent_ignore` on an existing show (Finding 2 narrowing). Failure it catches: the re-stage loop, the existing-show reject regression, and the permanent-freeze over-reach.
8. **Cutover regression.** `tests/sync/cutover.retireLivePendingSyncs.test.ts` must stay green unchanged (its MI-11+growth scenario has no pure shrinkage, so the narrowed filter doesn't touch it). Cross-reference in the new decision-rule test that the cutover's "never inserts a live pending_sync" claim now reads "for benign drift" — pure shrinkage is the deliberate, narrow exception.
9. **Approve round-trip (existing coverage check).** Confirm `applyStagedCore` UPDATE path covers the existing-show approve of a pure shrink (apply the smaller parse). Extend only if a gap surfaces.

## 9. Disagreement-loop preempt (for adversarial review)

**EXPLICITLY DO NOT RELITIGATE:**

- **"This reverses the PF34 / `retire_live_pending_syncs` cutover."** It narrows it, it does not reverse it. The cutover (`supabase/migrations/20260608000004_retire_live_pending_syncs.sql`) is a **one-shot residue sweep** — there is no CHECK/trigger forbidding future live rows. Its guarding test (`tests/sync/cutover.retireLivePendingSyncs.test.ts:57`) asserts only that **benign** drift (MI-11 email change + crew **growth**) never stages — it never exercises shrinkage. Material shrinkage is a distinct, higher-severity class the cutover deliberately did not consider. Benign drift still auto-applies exactly as PF34 intended.
- **"MI-11 + shrinkage still clobbers / bypasses the identity gate."** Addressed by D4 (revised) — the combined case NOW stages (last-good preserved, no clobber), persisting the MI-11 item so approve is fail-closed via P2-F7 (`applyStaged.ts:1264-1266`) → `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED`, never an ungated email apply. The only limitation is that a combined parse cannot be one-click *approved* (it must be rejected/deferred or fixed at the sheet); wiring approve-with-holds is `BL-RESYNC-STAGE-MI11-HOLDS` (§13). This is a deliberate fail-closed limitation, not a data-safety gap.
- **"permanent_ignore should be allowed for existing shows too."** Rejected by D6 — `permanent_ignore` unconditionally freezes a published show's auto-updates with no modified-time escape; the use case only needs `defer_until_modified`. Keeping it invalid for existing shows is deliberate (`discardStaged.ts:504-505`).
- **"Add a general worse-than-last-good comparator."** Out of scope by decision D2/§2 — the audit lists it as optional ("consider…"); `MI-6`/`MI-7` are the comparator.
- **"Gate MI-7b too."** Excluded by D3 with rationale — MI-7b fires on benign renames and would re-create the review-backlog problem PF34 fixed.
- **"Raise a dedicated admin alert."** Rejected by D2 — staging already pushes via the digest (`digest.ts:97`) and surfaces in the inbox (`needsAttention.ts:315`), consistent with every other staged item. A bespoke alert would duplicate the signal and add the full `_metaAdminAlertCatalog` + §12.4 lockstep for no marginal signal.

## 10. Routing / flag lifecycle

There is no new boolean flag. The routing decision is code-level (the filter). For completeness, the one config flag in the neighborhood — `getAutoPublishCleanFirstSeen` (`phase1.ts:360`) — is **not consulted** by this change: it gates only the `!show` clean-first-seen branch, which is disjoint from the material-shrink branch (D5).

## 11. Meta-test inventory

- **Creates/extends:** none structurally new. Adds decision-rule + DB-staging + reject-defer tests under `tests/sync/`.
- **Must stay green:** `tests/sync/cutover.retireLivePendingSyncs.test.ts`, `tests/sync/phase1.decision-rule.test.ts`, `tests/sync/discardStaged.test.ts`, `tests/messages/*` (unchanged catalog), `tests/auth/advisoryLockRpcDeadlock.test.ts` (no new lock holder), `tests/auth/_metaInfraContract.test.ts` (no new Supabase call boundary — `phase1` routing is pure in-memory; the `discardStaged` deferral write reuses the existing `upsertLiveDeferral` primitive, already registered).
- **Advisory-lock topology:** unchanged; no `pg_advisory*` edit. `phase1` runs inside the already-locked pipeline; `discardStaged` already owns its per-show lock.
- **UI / invariant 8:** the `existing_staged` reject control is a UI surface (`components/`/`app/` non-api). The one-control `defer_until_modified` addition engages the invariant-8 impeccable dual-gate (`/impeccable critique` + `audit`) at milestone close-out; HIGH/CRITICAL fixed or deferred via `DEFERRED.md`.

## 12. Numeric sweep

- `MI-6` threshold: `crewDrop > 1` (i.e., a drop of ≥2). Reused verbatim from `invariants.ts:251`. Not re-declared.
- `MI-7` threshold: `nc < pc/2 || pc <= 2` for hotels/rooms/contacts; transportation populated→null. Reused verbatim from `invariants.ts:266,284,302,317`.
- Staging condition: material-shrink items present (exactly 2 gated invariant tags: `MI-6`, `MI-7`); co-occurring `MI-11` items are persisted into the staged row but are NOT part of the staging trigger.
- Production files changed: 4 (`phase1.ts`, `discardStaged.ts`, the live apply route, one reject-UI control). New test surfaces: `tests/sync/phase1.decision-rule.test.ts` (extend), a DB-staging test, `tests/sync/discardStaged.test.ts` (extend), and a combined-case fail-closed apply test. No new fixtures, no schema, no new admin-alert code. ONE new §12.4 message code (`STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED`) with full lockstep.

## 13. Backlog

- **`BL-RESYNC-STAGE-MI11-HOLDS`** (files to `BACKLOG.md` at implementation): make the MI-6/MI-7 **+ MI-11** combined staged case one-click **approvable** (today it stages + fail-closes on approve → `STAGED_APPROVE_EMAIL_CHANGE_BLOCKED`, so the admin must reject/defer or fix the sheet). The full fix converts the persisted `MI-11` items into `sync_holds` on approve (email held, shrink applied), which requires replacing the `applyStaged` P2-F7 throw (`:1264-1266`) with correct hold derivation + `reviewerChoices`/`deriveAuthSideEffects` wiring, under its own security-boundary review + test. Deferred because (a) the combined case is rare, (b) this arc already preserves last-good and the identity gate for it (data-safe), and (c) reversing a fail-closed security boundary warrants a dedicated arc, not a rider on this one.
